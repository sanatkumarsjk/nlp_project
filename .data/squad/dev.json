They draw lots for the cloak, and one of the losers, Anaides, starts telling the audience what happens in the play to come; the others try to suppress him, interrupting him and putting their hands over his mouth. Soon they are fighting over the cloak and criticizing the author and the spectators as well.\nIn the play proper, the goddess Diana, also called Cynthia, has ordained a \"solemn revels\" in the valley of Gargaphie in Greece. The gods Cupid and Mercury appear, and they too start to argue. Mercury has awakened Echo, who weeps for Narcissus, and states that a drink from Narcissus's spring causes the drinkers to \"Grow dotingly enamored of themselves.\" The courtiers and ladies assembled for the Cynthia's revels all drink from the spring.\nAsotus, a foolish spendthrift who longs to become a courtier and a master of fashion and manners, also drinks from the spring; emboldened by vanity and self-love, he challenges all comers to a competition of \"court compliment.\" The competition is held, in four phases, and the courtiers are beaten. Two symbolic masques are performed within the play for the assembled revelers. At their conclusion, Cynthia (representing Queen Elizabeth) has the dancers unmask and shows that vices have masqueraded as virtues. She sentences them to make reparation and to purify themselves by bathing in the spring at Mount Helicon.\nThe figure of Actaeon in the play may represent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, while Cynthia's lady in waiting Arete may be Lucy, Countess of Bedford, one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting as well as Jonson's patroness.\nThe play is notably rich in music, as is typical for the theatre of the boys' companies, which originated as church choirs.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THE ACTOR WEARING THE BLACK CLOAK"}], "question": "WHO NORMALLY DELIVERS THE OPENING PROLOGUE IN THE PLAY?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THE GODDESS DIANA"}], "question": "WHAT NAME WAS CYNTHIA MORE FAMOUSLY KNOWN BY?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "NARCISSUS"}], "question": "WHO DOES ECHO WEEP FOR?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "FALL IN LOVE WITH THEMSELVES"}], "question": "WHAT DOES A DRINK FROM NARCISSUS'S SPRING CAUSE THE DRINKER TO DO?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "GARGAPHIE IN GREECE"}], "question": "IN WHAT VALLEY DID THE SOLEMN REVELS OF CYNTHIA TAKE PLACE?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "VIRTUES"}], "question": "WHAT DID THE  SYMBOLIC VICES DISGUISE THEMSELVES TO BE?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "TO BATHE IN THE SPRING OF HELICON"}], "question": "WHAT SENTENCE DID CYNTHIA GIVE TO THE SYMBOLIC VICES?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "ALL THE COURTIERS AND LADIES WHO ATTENDED CYNTHIA'S REVELS"}], "question": "WHO DRANK FROM THE SPRING AT CYNTHIA'S REVELS?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "4 PHASES"}], "question": "HOW MANY PHASES DID THE COURT COMPLIMENT COMPETITION HAVE?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "ASOTUS"}], "question": "WHO CHALLENGES THE COURTIERS TO COURT COMPLIMENT COMPETITION?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Four."}], "question": "How many phases does the competition have?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Queen Elizabeth."}], "question": "Who does Diana represent?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Echo"}], "question": "Who is sleeping at the beginning of the play?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gargaphie Valley Greece."}], "question": "Where is Narcissus's spring?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Greek mythology and Queen Elizabeth's Court"}], "question": "Which two societies are aligned in this play?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mount Helicon"}], "question": "Where do the dancers purify themselves?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Anaides"}], "question": "Which page performs the dialogue?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cupid"}], "question": "Who enters with Mercury?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Robert Devereux"}], "question": "Who is the 2nd Earl of Essex?", "id": "00fb61fa7bee266ad995e52190ebb73606b60b70"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Church choir"}], "question": "From where does this play originate?

Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.\nAfter several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.\nOn the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see it is called Crack in America how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.\nUpon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he's no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title.

"paragraphs": [{"context": " In a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His companion Elaine becomes concerned and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of the events of 1935, which took place when he was a prison officer, in charge of death row and the state's electric chair.\nIn 1935, Paul supervises fellow officers Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger and Percy Wetmore at Cold Mountain Penitentiary on what they refer to as the \"Green Mile\", Death Row. Paul, suffering from a severe bladder infection, receives a physically imposing, but mentally challenged, black man, John Coffey, into his custody; John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak, but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, but only Paul is bold enough to defy this. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard \"Del\" Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain.\nJohn begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures Paul's bladder infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead. Wharton had from the moment of his arrival been a troublemaker; he attacked the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped Percy briefly, racially insulted John, and revealed psychically to John that he is in fact responsible for the crime for which John was unjustly condemned. John then reveals the story psychically to Paul, but in so doing releases his supernatural energy into Paul. Percy, meanwhile, is committed to the insane asylum which, ironically, Wharton had come from, and where he, Percy, was hopeful of getting a job.\nJohn tells Paul, distraught over the notion of executing an innocent man, that he does in fact wish to die, as he views the world as a cruel place. Mentioning that he had never before seen a movie, John watches Top Hat with the other guards as a last request. That night, John is executed, although he refuses the customary hood, as he is afraid of the dark. Paul concludes his story by telling Elaine that John's was the last execution that either he or Brutus supervised; following Coffey's execution they both took jobs in the juvenile system.\nElaine realizes that, since he had a grown son in 1935, Paul must be much older than he looks. Paul reveals that he is, in fact, 108 years of age, and not only is he still alive, so is Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse. Paul then muses that if John's power could make a mouse live for as long as Mr. Jingles has, how much longer does he himself have left?", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Green

followed by French Police who are working with Scotland Yard under the direction of Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany). Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, a lover of Elise, who owes \u00c2\u0141744 million in back taxes, and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: Board the train to Venice; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce. Elise burns the note, evades the police and boards the train.\nOn the train, Elise selects Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp), who is apparently an American mathematics teacher from a community college in Wisconsin. She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. Meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous, as well as her ruse. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), the mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.\nElise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the Hotel Danieli in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police, ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw's men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce's head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.\nElise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her, but the man (Rufus Sewell) disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him through the crowd, but is stopped by Frank. Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him. After the police surprise Frank, Elise reads the note. She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw. Both parties are followed by the police. Frank is held handcuffed.\nWhen Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise's peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men. Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. To Elise's obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment.\nAcheson, receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position, rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman. The man, Lawrence Mason, says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone, for which he has been receiving payments. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a \"solution\" to this dilemma; to Elise's surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. When the police open the safe they find only one cheque: It is for \u00c2\u0141744 million. Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce, but Jones overrides him, reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full, Pearce's only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed, much to Acheson's frustration. Frank (Alexander) and Elise sail away together.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because her lover was wanted for not paying millions in back taxes and they thought she would lead
