Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is \"Everybody Knows\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show.\nNobody knows the true identity of \"Hard Harry\" or \"Happy Harry Hard-on,\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide\u00e2\u0080\u0094at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.\nEventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \"problem students,\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding.\nRealizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \"talk hard.\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is a high school student in Phoenix."}], "question": "Who is Mark Hunter?", "id": "0025577043f5090cd603c6aea60f26e236195594"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It takes place in Mark's parents basement.

In every land he passes through he usually meets only one or two persons; these meetings often (though not always) end in the death of those he meets, either at his own hand or by that of another. He learns of his own impending death, meets Krag again, and dies shortly after learning that he is in fact Nightspore himself. The book concludes with a final revelation from Krag (who claims to be known on Earth as \"Pain\") to Nightspore about the origin of the Universe.

His friend Jeff works in the same place, but as a porter. Their real dream is to perform as radio comedians on the air, with their own show. Unfortunately they haven't convinced anyone about their great sense of humor yet. When they try to help the station receptionist, Anne Mason, by setting up a false audition for the position as singer, they are almost fired for their antics.\nThe station has financial problems related to their current moody singer Rita Wilson, and try to find a way to get rid of her. Their prayers are heard when Rita is shot and killed during a blackout when she is rehearsing for a broadcast.\nPolice detectives Marty Phillips and Delaney arrive at the scene, and even though they haven't found the murder weapon, they start suspecting a wannabe cowboy singer, Tex Barton, who tried to slip out the back door after the shooting. He was in the audience when Rita was rehearsing before the blackout.\nStation producer Farrell is afraid of being suspected as well, since he had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting. He asks Frankie, who overheard the discussion, to not tell the police about it. As a sign of gratitude, Farrell promises to give Anne a real audition for the position as singer, which is empty since Rita is gone.\nFrankie soon finds the weapon used to shoot Rita, hidden in a ventilator duct. It turns out the gun belongs to Tex, and has been used in a prior shooting by a woman named Gladys Wharton. When Frankie and Jeff audition for a comedy spot on air (with Frankie in blackface as a disguise), the police come looking for Tex. Later, Tex is found murdered in the office of the station owner.\nFrankie and Jeff decide to do a little investigation of their own, and search Tex's room to see if they can find anything. The only thing of interest is a picture of Anne, suggesting that her real name is Gladys. Anne is therefore suspected of the murder and arrested by the police. However, a while later she makes bail and is released.\nFrankie discovers from a radio station in Cheyenne that the shooter Gladys Wharton was a blonde woman who fell for one of her superiors and left her husband - Tex. Since Anne is a true brunette, Frankie concludes that Rita could be Gladys instead of Anne.\nWhen all the station executives are gathered in one room by the police, one of them, Van Martin, pulls out a gun and confesses to both crimes. When Jeff enters the room unannounced, he accidentally knocks the gun out of Van's hand and the police arrest him.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To perform as radio comedians on the air with their own show."}], "question": "What is Frankie Ryan and his friend's real dream?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They were having financial problems."}], "question": "Why was the station trying to get rid of moody singer, Rita Wilson?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cowboy singer, Tex Barton."}], "question": "Who was in the audience while Rita Wilson was rehearsing and tried to slip out the back door before the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Station producer, Farrell."}], "question": "Who had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To give Anne a real audition for the position of singer since the position is empty."}], "question": "As a sign of gratitude, what does Farrell promise Frankie by not telling the police about Farrell and Rita's argument before her death?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a ventilator duct."}], "question": "Where was the weapon found used to kill Rita?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Anne."}], "question": "Who is arrested by the police and suspected of the murder of Rita?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In the office of the station owner."}], "question": "Where is Tex found murdered?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Van Martin."}], "question": "Who confesses to both crimes?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He accidentally knocks the gun out of Van Martin's hand and the police arrest him."}], "question": "What happens when Jeff enters the room unannounced?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He works as a page boy at a radio station in Hollywood."}], "question": "What is Frankie Ryan's career?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To perform as a comedian on a radio show."}], "question": "What is Frankie's dream job?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are almost fired for setting up a false audition for the role of a singer."}], "question": "What happens when Frankie and Jeff try to help the station receptionist?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are having financial difficulties."}], "question": "Why does the station want to get rid of their current singer?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is shot and killed when rehearsing for a broadcast."}], "question": "What happens to Rita during the blackout?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tex Barton, a wannabe cowboy singer."}], "question": "Who do the police suspect in the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had an argument with Rita before the shooting."}], "question": "Why is the station manager afraid he might be seen as a suspect?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Frankie finds it in a ventilator duct.

her dead first son would have been raised. Occupied with the domestic management of the Baldry estate just outside London, the two are almost completely removed from the horrors of World War I. The only exception is that Kitty's husband, Chris Baldry, is a British soldier fighting in France. While Kitty laments in the nursery, Margaret Grey arrives at the estate wishing to bear news to the two women. When Jenny and Kitty meet her, they are surprised to find a drab middle-aged woman. And even more to their shock, Margaret tells them that the War Office sent her, not Kitty and Jenny, notification of Chris's injury and return home. Kitty dismisses Margaret from the estate trying to deny that she could have been the recipient of such information.\nSoon after, another cousin of Jenny notifies the two women that he in fact has visited Chris and he is obsessing over Margaret, whom he had had a summer fling with fifteen years before. Soon after, Chris returns shell-shocked to the estate thinking he is still twenty years old, but finding himself in a strange world which had aged fifteen years beyond his memory. Trying to understand what is real for Chris, Jenny asks Chris to explain what he is feeling to be true. Chris tells her the story of a romantic summer on Monkey Island, where Chris at the age of twenty fell in love with Margaret, the daughter of the innkeeper on the island. The summer ends with a rash departure by Chris caused by a fit of jealousy.\nAfter Chris tells this story, Jenny travels to nearby Wealdstone to bring Margaret back to Chris and help him understand the difference between his remembered past and reality. She arrives at Margaret's dilapidated row-house to find her disheveled and taking care of her husband. After some conversation, Jenny convinces Margaret to return with her to the estate in order to help Chris. Upon Margaret's return, Chris recognizes her and becomes excited. Before returning to her home, Margaret explains that fifteen years have passed since their Monkey Island summer and that Chris is now married to Kitty. Chris acknowledges this passage of time intellectually but cannot retrieve his memories and still pines for Margaret.\nMargaret continues to visit, and Kitty and Jenny despair about Chris's loss of memory. Jenny and Kitty decide to consult Dr Gilbert Anderson, a psychoanalyst.

Mrs. Frisby's son, Timothy, is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat - the same cat who had killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he can't help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.\nMrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating, and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write, and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight mice who had been part of the experiments at NIMH, and made the rats' escape possible. Out of respect for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.\nNicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.\nTo move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon as it is too dangerous to work in the open without any place to hide. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the other rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats were electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men (who never identify themselves) who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbon's land free of charge for him.\nAt night, Justin (one of the rats) comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.\nThe successful house move allows the mouse family to remain while Timothy recovers before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms, and create the illusion that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay behind so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with poisonous gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.\nOnce Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home, and Martin makes plans to visit the rats when they return to their winter home again.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the farmer's cat"}], "question": "Who is Dragon?", "id": "04954299c7b6bdc7b31b951bc0daa277353576a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0,

been defeated in the civil war and has fled from London towards the New Forest. Parliamentary soldiers have been sent to search the forest and decide to burn Arnwood, the house of Colonel Beverley, a Cavalier officer killed at the Battle of Naseby. The four orphan children of the house, Edward, Humphrey, Alice and Edith, are believed to have died in the flames. However, they are saved by Jacob Armitage, a local verderer, who hides them in his isolated cottage and disguises them as his grandchildren.\nUnder Armitage's guidance, the children adapt from an aristocratic lifestyle to that of simple foresters. After Armitage's death, Edward takes charge and the children develop and expand the farmstead, aided by the entrepreneurial spirit of the younger brother Humphrey. They are assisted by a gypsy boy, Pablo, who they rescue from a pitfall trap. A sub-plot involves a hostile Puritan gamekeeper named Corbould who seeks to harm Edward and his family. Edward also encounters the sympathetic Puritan, Heatherstone, placed in charge of the Royal land in the New Forest, and rescues his daughter, Patience, in a house-fire. Edward leaves the cottage and works as a secretary for Heatherstone, but Edward maintains the pretence that he is the grandson of Jacob Armitage.\nEdward eventually joins the army of the future King Charles II, but after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, he returns to the New Forest where he learns that Heatherstone has been awarded the old Arnwood estate. Disillusioned by this, and by Patience's apparent rejection of his declarations of love, Edward flees to France. His sisters are sent away to be brought up as aristocratic ladies and his brother continues to live in the New Forest. Edward learns that Patience does, in fact, love him, and that Heatherstone had acquired the Arnwood estate for Edward, but he works as a mercenary soldier in exile until the Restoration when they are reunited.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Children of the New Forest"}], "question": "What is the title of this story?", "id": "04d0a3d15a1e39a94524a3958e433a88ca01fdf9"},

[{"context": " In the Australian Outback, a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends a rare giant eagle named Marahute, who shows him her nest and eggs. Later on, the boy unknowingly falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local poacher wanted by the Australian Rangers. When McLeach finds one of the eagle's feathers on the boy's backpack, he is instantly overcome with excitement, for he knows that catching an eagle that size would make him rich because he had caught one before, which was Marahute's mate. McLeach throws Cody's backpack to a pack of crocodiles in order to trick the Rangers into thinking that Cody was dead, and kidnaps him in his attempt to force him to reveal the whereabouts of Marahute.\nA mouse, the bait in the trap, runs off to alert the Rescue Aid Society. A telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in New York City, where Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS' elite field agents, are assigned to the mission, despite Bernard's attempts to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the albatross who aided them previously, but instead find his brother Wilbur. Bernard and Bianca convince Wilbur to fly them to Australia to save Cody. In Australia, they meet Jake, a hopping mouse who is the RAS' local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and starts flirting with her, despite Bernard's chagrin. He serves as their \"tour guide\" and protector in search of the missing boy.\nAt the same time, Wilbur is immobilized when his spinal column is bent out of its natural shape, convincing Jake to send him to a nearby hospital run by mice. Wilbur, terrified of the surgical equipment the doctor intends to use (including a chainsaw), refuses to undergo surgery and is forced to flee. His back is unintentionally straightened by the efforts of the mouse medical staff preventing him from escaping through a window. Cured, Wilbur departs in search of his friends. At McLeach's ranch, Cody has been thrown into the dungeon with several of McLeach's imprisoned animals for refusing to give up Marahute's whereabouts. Cody tries to free himself and the animals using various objects tied together with a hook on the end, but he is thwarted every time by Joanna, McLeach's pet goanna. Realizing that Marahute's eggs are Cody's weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking that Marahute has died, causing Cody to lead him straight to Marahute's nest.\nBernard, Bianca, and Jake, knowing that Cody is about to fall for a trap, jump onto McLeach's Halftrack to follow him. At Marahute's nest, the three mice try to warn Cody that he has been followed; for just as they do, McLeach arrives and captures Marahute, along with Cody, Jake, and Bianca. Following McLeach's orders, Joanna tries to eat Marahute's eggs, but realizes they are actually egg-shaped rocks. Frightened that McLeach might be angry with her, Joanna drops the stones over the cliff instead. When she leaves, Bernard crawls out of the nest with the hidden eggs, grateful that Joanna fell for the trick. Just then, Wilbur arrives at the nest, whereupon Bernard convinces him to sit on the eagle's eggs, so that Bernard can go after McLeach. Enraged by Cody's interference, McLeach takes his captives to Crocodile Falls, where he ties Cody up and hangs him over a group of crocodiles in attempts to feed him to them. But Bernard, riding a wild razorback pig he had tamed using a horse whispering technique that Jake used on a snake earlier, follows and disables McLeach's vehicle.\nMcLeach then tries to shoot the rope holding Cody above the water. To save Cody, Bernard tricks Joanna into crashing into McLeach, causing them to both fall into the water. This causes the crocodiles to turn their attention from Cody toward McLeach and Joanna, while behind them the badly damaged rope holding Cody breaks apart. McLeach fights and fends off the crocodiles, but although Joanna manages to reach the shoreline, McLeach is swept over the waterfall to his death. Bernard dives into the water to save Cody, but every time he fails. His actions, however, buy Jake and Bianca enough time to free Marahute so they can save both Cody and Bernard.\nBernard, desperate to prevent any further incidents, proposes to Bianca, who eagerly and happily accepts while Jake salutes him with a newfound respect. All of them depart for Cody's home. Back at the nest, Marahute's eggs finally hatch, much to Wilbur's dismay.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "an eagle"}], "question": "What kind of animal is Marahute?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "her nest and eggs"}], "question": "What does Marahute show Cody?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "mice"}], "question": "What kind of animals come to Cody's rescue?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a wild razorback"}], "question": "What does Bernard ride in on when he disables McLeach's vehicle?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to make people think he had died"}], "question": "Why did McLeach throw Cody's backpack into the water?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Austrailia"}], "question": "Where does the story take place?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bianca and Bernard's guide and protector"}], "question": "Who is Jake?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bernard"}], "question": "Who does Bianca get engaged to?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "rocks"}], "question": "What were the eggs that Joanna tried to eat?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bernard"}], "question": "Who hid the eggs from Joanna?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A rare giant eagle"}], "question": "What kind of animal does Cody rescue and befriend in the Australian Outback?", "id": "04ef491311759e1e853f9c7fc7e8c946c6eab31b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was a poacher"}], "question": "Why was Percival C.

Once they have discovered and punished the thieves, the storyline switches to the familiar one of the three shepherds being told of the birth of Christ by an angel, and going to Bethlehem to offer the true Child gifts.\nAt the start of the play, Coll, the first shepherd (\"primus pastor\") arrives in a field, invoking God in anachronistic terms (referring, as the shepherds will do throughout the play, to the life and death of Christ even though at this point of the play Christ has not yet been born) complaining about the (typically English) cold weather and about his poverty and the arrogance of local gentry. He begins by saying, \"Lord, what these weders are cold! And I am ill happyed\" which translates as \"God, the weather is cold and I am ill prepared/clothed.\" Gib, the second shepherd, arrives without seeing Coll and complains first about the weather and then about the plight of married men, himself included, with bawdy speculation about the lives of men with more than one wife and advice to \"young men of wooing\" to \"Be well war of weding\" (wary of marriage). He paints a portrait of his wife as a loud, heavy-drinking, alternately abusive and sentimentally pious, whale-sized woman. \"By him that died for us all, I would I had run til I had lost her!\" at which point he is startled by Coll. They confer about where Daw, a third, young, lazy and mischievous, shepherd, has gotten to, at which point Daw arrives complaining about employers, hunger, and about recent floods which he compares to Noah's flood.\nMak, a local good-for-nothing and well-known thief, arrives and pretends to be a yeoman from a lord. Although they recognize him from the start, he insults and threatens them by saying that he will have them flogged. When they threaten him, he pretends not to have known who they were. Mak tries to gain sympathy from the shepherds by explaining how his wife is a lazy drunk who gives birth to too many children. Invoking Christ and Pontius Pilate, Mak agrees to camp with the shepherds, and feigns to lie down among them. However, once they have fallen asleep he casts a spell to make sure they will not wake up and then sneaks off to steal one of their sheep. He heads back to his cottage and trades insults with Gill, his wife, who firmly believes that Mak will be hanged for the theft and comes up with a plan for hiding the sheep - she will put it in an empty cradle and pretend that it is her newborn child, and that she is loudly, painfully in labor with its twin, so that the shepherds will quickly give up any search.\nMak sneaks back among the shepherds and pretends to awaken along with them. They head off to take account of their sheep while Mak heads home to prepare. With despair at their catastrophic ill fortune, the shepherds realize a sheep is missing and go to search Mak's house. They are initially fooled by Mak and Gill's ruse despite Gill going so far as to say that if she's lying she'll eat the child in her cradle (as she indeed plans to). The shepherds leave defeated, but realize that they have failed to bring any gifts to the \"baby\", and go back. When they remove the swaddling clothes they recognize their sheep, but decide not to kill Mak but instead roll him in canvas and throw him up and down, punishing him until they are exhausted.\nWhen they have left Mak's cottage, the biblical story proper begins - the Angel appears and tells them to go to \"Bedlam\" (Bethlehem) to see the Christ child. They wonder at the event, chastising each other for their collective delay, and then go to the manger where Mary (Mother of Jesus) welcomes them and receives their praise for her mildness. They each address the Child in turn, beginning by praising His authority and His creation of all things in tones of reverence and awe, but each comically shifting mid-speech to cooing, gushing baby talk, since they are addressing an adorable baby, who Coll, Gib, and Daw respectively give \"a bob of cherries,\" a bird, and a ball (\"Have and play thee withal, and go to the tennis!\") The shepherds rejoice at their salvation, all thoughts of hardship and complaint vanished, and leave singing in unison.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Coll"}], "question": "Who is the first shepherd?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gib"}], "question": "Whose wife is described as a whale sized woman?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Daw"}], "question": "What shepherd complains about recent floods being similar to Noah's flood?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mak"}], "question": "Who pretends to be a yeoman?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Flogging"}], "question": "What type of punishment does Mak threaten the shepherds with?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It keeps them from waking up"}], "question": "What does the spell do that Mak puts on the shepherds?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gill"}], "question": "Who is Mak married to?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bedlam"}], "question": "What city are the shepherds directed to go to see the Christ child?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they forgot to give the baby a gift"}], "question": "Why do the shepherds go back to Mak's house once they leave?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gib"}], "question": "Who states that young men should be wary of marriage?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are delayed by trying to find the sheep that was stolen from them by Mak."}], "question": "Why do the shepherds arrive late to see the Christ child?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gib refers to \"Him that died for us all\" before Christ has been born, Mak invoking Christ and Pontius Pilate before Christ has been born, etc."}], "question": "What is a specific example of an anachronism in the story?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She pretends to be in labor with the twin of her unseen (and fake) new baby."}], "question": "How does Gill plan to get the shepherds to go away?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "So he can steal one of their sheep while they are asleep."}], "question": "Why does Mak want to stay overnight with the shepherds?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She convinces them the hidden sheep is a baby, and they return to bring the child gifts."}], "question": "How does Gill's plan to trick the shepherds backfire?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They respect Mary for her mildness, whereas they insult and complain about their wives."}], "question": "How do the shepherds' views of Mary contrast to their views of other women?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They treat Him reverentially, and praise His authority."}], "question": "How do the shepherds treat the Christ child differently than they would another baby?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They coo and talk \"baby talk\" to Him, they give Him gifts a child would like."}], "question": "How do the shepherds treat the Christ child the same as they would another baby?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "gib complains about the weather and then the plight of married men."}], "question": "What does gib complain about?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he complains about thirst , hunger and floods."}], "question": "What does daw compalin about?", "id": "0507acab5483574fd74d15921e6a7de500413ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he complains about poverty, cold weather and arrogance of local gentry.

While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish, the state champion wrestler Andrew Clarke, the bookish Brian Johnson, the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds, and the rebellious delinquent John Bender.\nThey gather in the high school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00\u00c2\u00a0p.m. He assigns them a 1,000-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are.\" He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them. John, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students, teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire. Allison is initially quiet, except for an occasional random outburst. Over the course of the day, Vernon gives John several weekends' worth of additional detention and even locks him in a storage closet, but he escapes and returns to the library.\nThe students pass the hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking cannabis that John retrieves from his locker. Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; John comes from an abusive household; Brian was planning to kill himself with a flare gun due to a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; John's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.\nDespite their differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses. Claire gives Allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" virgin appearance by kissing John in the closet and giving him a hickey. Although they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers afterwards.\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone and John returns to the storage closet to fool Vernon into thinking he has not left. Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. One by one, the five students' voices add, \"But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal.\" Brian signs the letter as \"The Breakfast Club.\" John raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the school football field toward home.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "John Bender is a rebellious delinquent, which may be a product of his father's abuse.

LAPD Sgt. John Spartan uses a thermal scan of the building and finds no trace of the hostages, and leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. When he is captured, Phoenix sets off a series of explosives that bring down the building, and when the police search the wreckage, they find the corpses of the hostages. Spartan is charged with manslaughter, and he is incarcerated along with Phoenix in the city's new \"California Cryo-Penitentiary\", where they will be cryogenically frozen. During their time \"in deep freeze\", they are to be rehabilitated through subconscious conditioning.\nDuring their incarceration, the \"Great Earthquake\" leads the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara to merge into a single metropolis under the name San Angeles. The city becomes a utopia run under the pseudo-pacifist guidance and control of the evangelistic Dr. Raymond Cocteau, where human behavior is tightly controlled. In 2032, Phoenix is woken for a parole hearing, but he finds he somehow knows the access codes to the security systems, and is able to escape the prison and begins wreaking havoc on the city. The police, having not dealt with violent crime for many years, are unable to handle Phoenix and opt to wake Spartan and enlist his help. Spartan is assigned to Lieutenant Lenina Huxley to help with acclimation to the future, which he finds depressing. Others on the police force find his behavior brutish and uncivilized, though Huxley, who is fascinated by the lifestyles of the late 20th century, helps Spartan to overcome this, and the two grow close, despite the limitations on displays of public affection.\nThey attempt to stop Phoenix from stealing 20th century weapons from a museum display, but Phoenix manages to escape. Phoenix encounters Dr. Cocteau during his escape, and though he tries to shoot him, finds himself unable to do so. Dr. Cocteau calmly asks Phoenix to assassinate Edgar Friendly, the leader of the resistance group called the Scraps that fight against Cocteau's rule, and allows Phoenix to bring other criminals out of cryo-sleep to help at his request. Meanwhile, Spartan and Huxley review the cryo-prison records and find that instead of the normal rehabilitation program, Phoenix had been given the information necessary for his escape by Cocteau directly. They also discover information directing Phoenix towards Friendly, and go off to warn him.\nAt the Scraps' underground base, Friendly is initially distrustful but Spartan is able to convince him of the threat and takes sympathy in their cause given what he has seen above ground. When Phoenix and his gang attack, Spartan and the Scraps ward off the attack, leading to a car chase between Spartan and Phoenix. During the chase, Phoenix taunts Spartan by revealing that he had killed the hostages before Spartan had arrived in 1996. Phoenix escapes while Spartan comes to terms that he had been wrongly charged with the crime. Meanwhile, Friendly and the Scraps work with the police to try to help stop Phoenix and his gang of cryo-cons.\nPhoenix returns to Dr. Cocteau with his gang, and as the rehabilitation programming prevents him from killing Cocteau, orders one of his gang to do so. Spartan and Huxley arrive soon after, finding that Phoenix has already left to release more prisoners. Spartan enters the prison alone to fight Phoenix, engages in a violent fight that ravages the facility, and eventually uses the cryogenic chemical to freeze Phoenix before shattering him. Spartan escapes the prison before it explodes and regroups with the police and the Scraps. The police fear the loss of Cocteau will send their society into a downward spiral, but Spartan suggests that they and the Scraps work together to recreate a society that returns some of the personal freedoms that were lost. He then kisses Huxley and the two go off together.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Manslaughter.

Writer Jack London wrote \"Wace's\" letters, and Anna Strunsky wrote \"Kempton's.\" In the late 19th century, the authors were part of a San Francisco radical literary group known as \"The Crowd.\"\nKempton makes the case for feeling and emotion, while Wace proceeds \"scientifically\" and analyzes love in Darwinian terms:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI purpose to order my affairs in a rational manner....Wherefore I marry Hester Stebbins. I am not impelled by the archaic sex madness of the beast, nor by the obsolescent romance madness of later-day man. I contract a tie which reason tells me is based upon health and sanity and compatibility. My intellect shall delight in that tie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nInitially the public was piqued by the anonymity of the writers and the book was moderately successful. London biographer Russ Kingman praised the book; he quoted the Buffalo Commercial as admiring the \"sheer charm of its prose\" and saying the book \"holds firmly its place in the front rank of the best of the season's publications.\"\nThe New York Times was less charitable. It opened its review with the terse line, \"The sex problem again.\" It complained that \"Nothing that the scientist says is new, nothing that the poet says is new. The thing has been thrashed out some millions of times... Nor does the unnamed author infuse into either Wace or Kempton anything to give human personality or appeal.... As a story [it] falls flat; as a discussion of a topic as old as interesting, as overworked.\"\nJoseph Noel says that George Sterling described London's portion of the book, as \"a spiritual misprint, a typographical error half a volume long\" and says \"His vocabulary, in the letters of Herbert Wace, sounds as if taken that day from an encyclopedia by a conscientious sophomore.\"\nBiographers have been intrigued by The Kempton-Wace Letters for the light it seems to shed on Jack London's life and ideas. Strunsky was named as the co-respondent in Jack London's divorce from his first wife, Bessie, but biographers generally agree that his relation with the younger Strunsky was platonic. They were active in socialism and the literary group, \"The Crowd\", in San Francisco.\nIn the novel, London expresses his theories about the \"Mother-Woman\" and the \"Mate-Woman,\" roles which seem to correspond to the roles played by his first wife and his second. After London's death in 1916, Strunsky published a memoir in The Masses in 1917 about their relationship.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Russ Kingman"}], "question": "Which named critic gave a positive review of the novel?

One day the son of his gardener, Gordon Ngubene (Winston Ntshona), gets beaten by the white police and gets caught by the police during a peacefully demonstration for a better education policy for blacks in South Africa. Gordon asks Ben for help. After Ben refuses to help because of his trust in the police, Gordon gets caught by the police as well and is tortured. Against the will of his family, Ben tries to find out more about the disappearance of his gardener by himself. Seeing the weakness and helplessness of the blacks, he decides to bring this incident up before a court with Ian McKenzie (Marlon Brando) as lawyer but loses. Afterwards, he continues to act by himself and supports a small group of blacks to interview others to find out what happened to Gordon.\nThe white police notices their intentions and detains some responsible persons. They continue and (to increase their safety) hide the information at Ben's house. Ben lets his son in on his plans. His son and his daughter both get to know the hiding spots, and after the police searched through Ben's house earlier, there is an explosion next to the hiding spot because the daughter betrayed it to the police though the son saved the documents. Gordon's wife, Emily (Thoko Ntshinga) and children are captured as well. Ben's wife and daughter leave. The daughter offers her father to get the documents to a safer place.\nThey meet at a restaurant and Ben gives her the fake documents, which she delivers to the police man.

For all the destruction the mice wreak, it is miniaturized and thus more amusing than serious. Potter enjoyed developing a tale that gave her the vicarious thrill of the sort of improper behaviour she would never have entertained in real life.\nThe tale begins with \"once upon a time\" and a description of a \"very beautiful doll's-house\" belonging to a doll called Lucinda and her cook-doll Jane. Jane never cooks because the doll's-house food is made of plaster and was \"bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings\". Though the food will not come off the plates, it is \"extremely beautiful\".\nOne morning the dolls leave the nursery for a drive in their perambulator. No one is in the nursery when Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca, two mice living under the skirting board, peep out and cross the hearthrug to the doll's-house. They open the door, enter, and \"squeak for joy\" when they discover the dining table set for dinner. It is \"all so convenient!\" Tom Thumb discovers the food is plaster and loses his temper. The two smash every dish on the table \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"bang, bang, smash, smash!\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and even try to burn one in the \"red-hot crinkly paper fire\" in the kitchen fireplace.\nTom Thumb scurries up the sootless chimney while Hunca Munca empties the kitchen canisters of their red and blue beads. Tom Thumb takes the dolls' dresses from the chest of drawers and tosses them out the window while Hunca Munca pulls the feathers from the dolls' bolster. In the midst of her mischief, Hunca Munca remembers she needs a bolster and the two take the dolls' bolster to their mouse-hole. They carry off several small odds and ends from the doll's-house including a cradle, however a bird cage and bookcase will not fit through the mouse-hole. The nursery door suddenly opens and the dolls return in their perambulator.\nLucinda and Jane are speechless when they behold the vandalism in their house.

Holden is the friendly, more mild-mannered half of the duo; Banky, meanwhile, is the loud and fiery half. Everything is going well for them until they meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York City where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.\nThis new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname \"Finger Cuffs\". Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her \"many\" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.\nLater, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has \"spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.\"\nMoved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him\u00e2\u0080\u0094kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a threesome. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his \"whore.\" Banky also leaves the apartment, instantly ending their friendship.\nOne year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Banky smiles sadly at seeing his old friend, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own comic. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her. He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa feigns indifference and replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Holden"}], "question": "Between Holden and Banky, which

Holmes, who is apparently dying of a rare disease contracted while he was on a case. Watson was shocked, having heard about his friend\u2019s illness. Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days.\nHolmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or send for a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. So, Watson is forced to wait, in extreme worry as Holmes mutters nonsense.\nWhile Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes\u2019s room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches items explaining that he does not like his things touched.\nAt six o\u2019clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half-full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives.\nWatson goes to Smith's address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith's attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith's arrival.\nBelieving that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It soon emerges, to the hiding Watson\u2019s horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith\u2019s nephew Victor. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die.\nHolmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies \u2014 no longer in the voice of a man near death \u2014 \"a match and a cigarette.\" Inspector Morton then enters \u2014 the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith, still as arrogant as ever, points out that his word is as good as Holmes\u2019s in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation.\nHolmes was never really dying. His feigned illness was a ruse to induce Smith to confess to his nephew\u2019s murder. Holmes was not infected by the little box; he has enough enemies to know that he must always examine his mail carefully before he opens it. Starving himself for three days,and the claim of the \"disease's\" infectious nature was to keep Watson from examining him and discovering the ruse.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

Tittlemouse is a tale in which no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have occurred since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.\nMrs. Tittlemouse is a \"most terribly tidy little mouse always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors\" in the \"yards and yards\" of passages and storerooms, nut-cellars, and seed-cellars in her \"funny house\" amongst the roots of a hedge. She has a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, a larder, and a bedroom where she keeps her dust-pan and brush next to her little box bed. She tries to keep her house tidy, but insect intruders leave dirty footprints on the floors and all sorts of messes about the place.\nA beetle is shooed away, a ladybird is exorcised with \"Fly away home! Your house is on fire!\", and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet is turned away with little ceremony. In a distant passage, Mrs. Tittlemouse meets Babbitty Bumble, a bumble bee who has taken up residence with three or four other bees in one of the empty storerooms. Mrs. Tittlemouse tries to pull out their nest but they buzz fiercely at her, and she retreats to deal with the matter after dinner.\nIn her parlour, she finds her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson sitting before the fire in her rocking chair. Mr. Jackson lives in \"a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch\". His coat tails drip with water and he leaves wet footmarks on Mrs. Tittlemouse's parlour floor. She follows him about with a mop and dish-cloth.\nMrs. Tittlemouse allows Mr. Jackson to stay for dinner, but the food is not to his liking, and he rummages about the cupboard searching for the honey he can smell. He discovers a butterfly in the sugar bowl, but when he finds the bees, he makes a big mess pulling out their nest. Mrs. Tittlemouse fears she \"shall go distracted\" as a result of the turmoil and takes refuge in the nut-cellar. When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her front door to keep Mr. Jackson out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again.\nThe fastidious little mouse spends a fortnight spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with beeswax and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds a party for five other little wood-mice wearing their Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through the window to him and he toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A dust pan and brush"}], "question":

"paragraphs": [{"context": " Andy Kaufman's (Jim Carrey) \"foreign man\" character appears in black and white, declaring that (due to massive editing), this is actually the end of the film, not the beginning. He plays a phonograph record alongside the credits before walking somberly off. Kaufman then comes back, and, in his normal voice, claiming he \"had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try,\" he proceeds to show the story of his life on a film projector, starting with his childhood home in Great Neck, New York, circa 1957.\nKaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his peculiar \"foreign man\" puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.\nHe catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role on Taxi, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. He secretly hates doing the show, however, and expresses a desire to quit.\nInvited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \"villain character\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Once again, the gag is on the audience.\nKaufman's fame increases with his Saturday Night Live appearances, but he has problems with his new-found fame. When he travels to college campuses, audiences dislike his strange sense of humor and demand that he perform as Latka, so he deliberately antagonizes them by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\"\nKaufman decides to become a professional wrestler\u00e2\u0080\u0094but to emphasize the \"villain\" angle, he would wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself \"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.\" He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love), and they begin a romantic relationship.\nProblems arise when an appearance on a live TV comedy show, ABC's Fridays, turns into a fiasco when Kaufman refuses to speak his lines. Also, the wrestling Kaufman enjoys getting a rise out of the crowds and feuds publicly with Jerry Lawler, a professional male wrestler, who challenges Kaufman to a \"real\" wrestling match, which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and seriously injures Kaufman, resulting in the comedian wearing a neck brace. Lawler and an injured Kaufman appear on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, theoretically to call a truce, but Lawler insults Kaufman, who throws a drink at the wrestler and spews a vicious tirade of epithets. It is later revealed, however, that Kaufman and Lawler were in fact good friends, and staged the entire feud, but despite this, Andy pays a price when he is banned from Saturday Night Live by a vote of audience members, weary of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler not to work together again, and later calls Kaufman to inform him that Taxi has been canceled.\nAfter a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. They aren't sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another Kaufman stunt, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank. With a short time to live, Kaufman gets a booking at Carnegie Hall, his dream venue. The performance is a memorable success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. His health deteriorates. Desperate, he heads to the Philippines to seek a medical \"miracle\" (actually psychic surgery), where doctors supposedly pull out infected organs from the body; he discovers the scam and laughs at the irony. He dies soon after. Friends and loved ones do a sing-along with a video of Andy at his funeral.\nOne year later, in 1985, Tony Clifton appears at Andy Kaufman's tribute at The Comedy Store's main stage performing, \"I Will Survive.\" The camera pans over the crowd and reveals Zmuda in the audience. During the final credits, Kaufman briefly peeks in black-and-white again.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Great Neck, New York"}], "question": "Where is Andy Kaufman from?", "id":

Having served time for infecting the FBI's Carnivore program with a computer virus, he is now on parole but forbidden from touching computers. His alcoholic ex-wife Melissa (Drea de Matteo), who married a rich porn producer and is currently a part-time porn actress has sole custody over their daughter Holly, and a restraining order preventing him from visiting the latter. One day, he is solicited by Ginger Knowles (Halle Berry), speaking for her boss Gabriel Shear (John Travolta), for his hacking skills. He goes to meet Gabriel in Los Angeles, where he is put on the spot to crack a secure government server within a minute while simultaneously held at gunpoint and receiving fellatio. Successful, Gabriel offers Stanley $10\u00c2\u00a0million to program multi-headed worm, a \"hydra\", to siphon $9.5\u00c2\u00a0billion from several government slush funds.\nStanley begins work, learning that Gabriel leads Black Cell, a secret group created by J. Edgar Hoover to launch retaliatory attacks against terrorists that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a DEA agent working undercover, and further is surprised to discover a corpse that looks like Gabriel. He goes to see Holly home from school but finds he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts (Don Cheadle), who had previously caught Stanley. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley closely, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds (Rudolf Martin), had been killed by Gabriel's men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a back door in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, Senator Reisman (Sam Shepard), who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI has started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses, and narrowly avoids an assassination attempt ordered by Reisman. Gabriel personally kills Reisman in revenge and continues his plan.\nStanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel has killed Melissa and her husband and kidnapped Holly, framing Stanley. Stanley has no choice but to participate with the bank heist to get Holly back. Gabriel and his men storm a Worldbanc branch, and secure its employees and customers as hostages and fitting each with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to Claymore mines. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to the coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time to discuss the film Dog Day Afternoon and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation. A sniper kills the man, and other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, causing the bomb to detonate, ravaging the buildings and vehicles on the street and killing several people, a scene shown in medias res at the start of the film.\nGabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra, and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, Stanley's back door triggers before they can leave the bank, and Stanley is recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, who he knows is a DEA agent, unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a Monte Carlo bank. Despite doing so, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages on a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by a S-64 Aircrane and deposited on a roof of a local skyscraper. Gabriel deactivates the bombs and departs with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter, which Stanley shoots down using a rocket-propelled grenade from the bus.\nRoberts takes Stanley to verify the corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a Mossad agent while there was no record of a DEA agent named Ginger. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and personally realizes that the whole scenario was misdirection. Gabriel had escaped a different route, and Ginger had been wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel. Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, and the two tour the US together. In Monte Carlo Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the money, and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. Over the film's credits, a news report describes the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in as many weeks.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Infecting the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Carnivore program with a computer virus."}], "question": "What Stanley Jobson did served time in jail for?", "id": "0c1274df8299049d4959ef8a1ea23a6a68e26f6e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To steal $9.5 billion from the government using his hacking abilities."}], "question": "What did Gabriel Shear want to hire Stanley Jobson for?

Rodrigue's father, Don Di\u00e8gue, is the old upstart general of Kingdom of Castile and past his prime, whereas Chim\u00e8ne's father is the successful current general, Comte de Gormas. Rodrigue and Chim\u00e8ne love each other, but any chance of marriage is brutally disturbed when Chim\u00e8ne's father insults Rodrigue's father. Torn between his love for Chim\u00e8ne and his duty to avenge his father's honour, Rodrigue chooses the latter and faces the general in a duel in which Don Gormas is killed. Without denying her love, Chim\u00e8ne asks the King for Rodrigue's head.\nWhen the Moors attack, Rodrigue gets the chance to redeem himself in the eye of the nation, and, more importantly, gets a chance to win back Chim\u00e8ne with honour still satisfied. His victories on the battlefield win him the renown of the people, the title of \"the Cid\", and the gratitude of the King.\nChim\u00e8ne then approaches the King to request that one of his knights duel with Rodrigue for her honor's sake, with the goal of bringing her Rodrigue's head. Chim\u00e8ne chooses Don Sanche as her champion; although she dislikes him, she agrees to marry whoever is the victor of the duel to the death. The King agrees to the duel unhappily (he does not want to risk losing Rodrigue).\nRodrigue speaks to Chim\u00e8ne privately, saying that he will not defend himself against what is symbolically \"her\" hand. She finally persuades him to do his best, because if he wins, they will marry.\nAfter the duel, Don Sanche (Chim\u00e8ne's champion), carrying a bloody sword, comes to where she is waiting. Chim\u00e8ne assumes the worst without giving him the chance to speak. Going before the king, she finally feels free to confess her love for Rodrigue because she believes him to be dead. Don Sanche then explains that Rodrigue disarmed him and granted him mercy. After the duel, Rodrigue returns straight to the king, leaving Don Sanche to bring his sword to Chim\u00e8ne.\nAlthough they love each other, Chim\u00e8ne and Rodrigue are reluctant to marry because of their history, but the king says that although it seemed impossible at first, circumstances have proven that they were meant to be together. Still, he realizes they need time to adapt. Chim\u00e8ne will set the date for the wedding, up to a year in advance.

Zuleika's current occupation (though, more importantly, perhaps, her enrapturing beauty) has made her something of a small-time celebrity and she manages to gain entrance to the privileged, all-male domain of Oxford University because her grandfather is the Warden of Judas College (based on Merton College, Beerbohm's alma mater). There, she falls in love for the first time in her life with the Duke of Dorset, a snobbish, emotionally detached student who\u2014frustrated with the lack of control over his feelings when he sees her\u2014is forced to admit that she too is his first love, impulsively proposing to her. As she feels that she cannot love anyone unless he is impervious to her charms, however, she rejects all her suitors, doing the same with the astonished Duke. The Duke quickly discovers that Noaks, another Oxford student, also claims to have fallen in love with her, without ever having even interacted with her. Apparently, men immediately fall in love with her upon seeing her. As the first to have his love reciprocated by her (for however brief a time) the Duke decides that he will commit suicide to symbolise his passion for Zuleika and in hopes that he will raise awareness in her of the terrible power of her bewitching allure, as she innocently goes on crushing men's affections.\nZuleika is able to interrupt the Duke's first suicide attempt from a river boat, but seems to have a romanticised view of men dying for her, and does not oppose the notion of his suicide altogether. The Duke, instead pledging to kill himself the next day\u2014which Zuleika more or less permits\u2014has dinner that night with his social club where the other members also affirm their love for Zuleika. Upon telling them of his plan to die, the others unexpectedly agree to also commit suicide for Zuleika. This idea soon reaches the minds of all Oxford undergraduates, who inevitably fall in love with Zuleika upon first sight.\nThe Duke eventually decides that the only way he can stop all the undergraduates from killing themselves is by not committing suicide himself, hoping they will follow his example. By an ancient tradition, on the eve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the battlements of Tankerton Hall, the family seat; the owls remain there hooting through the night and at dawn they fly away to an unknown place. After debating whether to follow through with his suicide, while seeming to decide at last to embrace his life as just as valuable as Zuleika's, the Duke receives a telegram from his butler at Tankerton, reporting the portentous return of the owls. The Duke promptly interprets the omen as a sign that the gods have decreed his doom. He proudly tells Zuleika that he will still die, but no longer for her; she agrees as long as he makes it appear that he is dying for her by shouting her name as he jumps into the river. Later the same day, a thunderstorm overwhelms the Eights Week boat races while the Duke drowns himself in the River Isis, wearing the robes of a Knight of the Garter.

a fishing holiday to the remote village of Kraighten in rural Ireland. On the third day of their stay, they stumble upon the ruins of a strangely shaped house on a large lake. They discover the mouldering journal of the Recluse, an unidentified man who recorded his last days in the house before its destruction.\nThe Recluse begins his journal with descriptions of how he acquired the house, along with his daily life with his sister and his faithful dog, Pepper. He started the diary to record the strange experiences and horrors occurring in and around the house. The Recluse relates a vision in which he travels to a remote and vast arena, \"the Plain of Silence\", surrounded by mountains with representations of mythological beast-gods, demons, and other \"bestial horrors\" on their slopes. In the center of the plain stands a house almost identical to his own, save that the house in the arena is much larger and appears to be made of a green jade-like substance. Along the way, he sees a huge, menacing humanoid with swine-like features.\nShortly after his vision of the \"arena,\" he is attacked by humanoid pig-like creatures that he names \"the swine-things\", which appear to come from the depths of a great chasm under the house. The struggle with these creatures lasts for several nights of increasing ferocity, but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. As he searches for the origin of the swine-things, the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. There he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. A rock slide dams the water in the pit. The man is trapped, but Pepper rescues him. The house transports the Recluse to an unknown place called \"the Sea of Sleep\" where he briefly reunites with his lost love.\nTonnison and Berreggnog must stop reading there as the house collapse has destroyed much of the journal. Except for an enigmatic fragment, the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing \"the Sea of Sleep\" and a later entry titled \"The noise in the night\". They realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. They suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house.\nAs the Recluse's story continues, he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed, eventually blurring into a never-ending twilight. As he watches, his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. The dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. Once the world ends, the man floats through space, seeing angelic, human, and demonic forms passing before his eyes. Later, he finds himself back in his own study on Earth, with everything apparently returned to normality, with one exception: Pepper is dead.\nThe malicious swine-beast from his earlier journeys to the \"arena\" has followed him back to his own dimension. The creature infects the man's new dog with a luminous fungal disease. Although the man shoots the suffering animal, he also contracts the disease. The manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. As he ponders suicide to end his suffering, the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends.\nTonnison and Berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. They learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it.

It connects the previous two installments, bringing in characters introduced in each. Burroughs completes the revelation of his lost world's unique biological system, only hinted at in the previous installment, in which the slow progress of evolution in the world outside is recapitulated as a matter of individual metamorphosis. This system forms a thematic element serving to unite the three otherwise rather loosely linked Caspak stories.The book begins with Bradley, who had left Fort Dinosaur on an expedition in the first novel and never returned. Bradley and his party are attempting to return to Fort Dinosaur. Along the way, they encounter a creature which appears to be a flying dead man. Some of the members of the party consider it to be a ghost or banshee. Tippet is convinced that he is soon to die, and the next day he is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The ghost-like creature is seen again, and James is killed by a Smilodon. Bradley disappears during the night, and the remaining members of the party make it safely to Fort Dinosaur.\nBradley had been captured by the ghost-like creature, which is soon revealed to be a naturally winged human being, belonging to a subgroup of humanity known as the Wieroo. The Wieroo takes Bradley to the island of Oo-oh, set in Caspak's inland sea. It attempts to keep Bradley in a prison, but he escapes through a secret passage. He meets Co-Tan, a member of the highest human race of mainland Caspak, the Galu, fully human and of a neolithic cultural level. They enter the chamber of the Wieroo king, a huge member of the race, and Bradley kills the creature with its own sword.\nCo-Tan and Bradley escape the city of the Wieroo and live for several months on the forested coast of Oo-oh. Finally, though, they are discovered by Wieroo. They succeed in capturing two of the Wieroo and forcing them to fly to the mainland, one bearing each of the humans.\nOn the Caspakian mainland, Co-Tan and Bradley meet the party from the outside

Philip has a club foot and his father had died a few months before. Now orphaned, he is sent to live with his aunt Louisa and uncle William Carey.\nEarly chapters relate Philip's experiences at his uncle's vicarage. Aunt Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle takes a cold disposition towards him. Philip's uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to find ways to escape his mundane existence. Less than a year later, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt wish for him to eventually attend Oxford. Philip's disability and sensitive nature make it difficult for him to fit in with the other students. Philip is informed that he could have earned a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster see as a wise course, but Philip insists on going to Germany.\nIn Germany, Philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners. He enjoys his stay in Germany. Philip's guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they persuade him to move to London to take up an apprenticeship. He does not fare well there as his co-workers resent him, because they believe he is a \"gentleman\". He goes on a business trip with one of his managers to Paris and is inspired by the trip to study art in France. In France, Philip attends art classes and makes new friends, including Fanny Price, a poor and determined but talentless art student who does not get along well with people. Fanny Price falls in love with Philip, but he does not know and has no such feelings for her; she subsequently commits suicide.\nPhilip realizes that he will never be a professional artist. He returns to his uncle's house in England to study medicine and pursue his late father's field. He struggles at medical school and comes across Mildred, who is working as a waitress in a tea shop. He falls desperately in love with her, and they date regularly, although she does not show any affection for him. Mildred tells Philip she is getting married to another man, leaving him heartbroken; Philip subsequently enters into an affair with Norah Nesbit, a kind and sensitive author of penny romance novels. Later Mildred returns, pregnant, and confesses that the man for whom she had abandoned Philip never married her.\nPhilip breaks off his relationship with Norah and supports Mildred financially, though he can ill afford to do so. To Philip's dismay, after Mildred has her baby she falls in love with his good friend Harry Griffiths, and runs away with him. About a year later, Philip runs into Mildred again and, feeling sympathy for her, takes her in again. Though he no longer loves her, he becomes attached to her baby. When he rejects her advances, she becomes angry with him, destroys most of his belongings, and leaves forever. In shame, and quickly running out of money, Philip leaves the house for good. He meets Mildred once more towards the end of the novel, when she summons him for his medical opinion. As she is probably suffering from syphilis resulting from her work as a prostitute, Philip advises Mildred to give up this life. Mildred declines and exits from the plot, her fate remaining unknown.\nWhile working at a hospital, Philip befriends family man, Thorpe Athelny. Athelny has lived in Toledo, Spain. Enthusiastic about the country, he is translating the works of St. John of the Cross. Meanwhile, Philip invests in mines but is left nearly penniless because of events surrounding the Boer War. Unable to pay his rent, he wanders the streets for several days before the Athelnys take him in and find him a department store job, which he hates. His talent for drawing is discovered and he receives a promotion and a raise in salary, but his time at the store is short-lived. After his uncle William dies, Philip inherits enough money to allow him to finish his medical studies and he finally becomes a licensed doctor. Philip takes on a temporary placement at a hospital with Dr. South, an old, cantankerous physician whose wife is dead and whose daughter has broken off contact with him. However, Dr. South takes a shine to Philip's humour and personable nature, eventually offering Philip a partnership in his medical practice. Although flattered, Philip refuses because of his plans to visit Spain.\nHe soon goes on a small summer vacation with the Athelnys, hop-picking in the Kent countryside. There he finds that one of Athelny's daughters, Sally, likes him. In a moment of romantic abandon one evening they have sex, and when she thinks she is pregnant, Philip decides to marry Sally and accept Dr. South's offer, instead of traveling the world as he had planned. They meet in the National Gallery where, despite learning that it was a false alarm, Philip becomes engaged to Sally, concluding that \"the simplest pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died, was likewise the most perfect.\" He stops searching for happiness and decides to be content with his lot.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nine years old"}], "question": "How old is Philip when his mother passes away?", "id": "0ebf71697ef16b7948f05a21dbf7abb34a818380"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "London"}], "question": "When Philip is living in Germany, where is he encouraged to move to?

Upon Sailor's release, Lula picks him up at the prison where she hands him his snakeskin jacket. They go to a hotel where she reserved a room, make love and go to see the speed metal band Powermad. At the club, Sailor gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Love Me\". Later, back in the room, after making love again, Sailor and Lula finally decide to run away to California, breaking Sailor's parole. Marietta arranges for private detective Johnnie Farragut \u2013 her on-off boyfriend \u2013 to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, however, Marietta also hires gangster Marcello Santos to track them and kill Sailor. Santos's minions capture and kill Farragut, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled psychosis.\nUnaware of all of the events happening back in North Carolina, Lula and Sailor continue on their way until \u2013 according to Lula \u2013 they witness a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dies in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts \"old friend\" Perdita Durango, who might be able to help them, although she secretly knows he is under contract to be killed by Lula's mother. While Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailor's child. While Sailor is out Peru enters the room and forces Lula to implore him to make love with her, but in the end he refuses, stating he has no time. This traumatizes Lula, who had survived a rape as a child.\nThe robbery goes spectacularly wrong when Peru unnecessarily shoots the two clerks. Peru then admits to Sailor he's been hired to kill him and Sailor realizes he has been given a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is about to kill him when the sheriff's deputy opens fire on him and Peru accidentally blows his own head off with his own shotgun. Sailor is arrested and sentenced to six years in prison.\nWhile Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Upon his release Lula decides to reunite with him. Rejecting her mother's objections over the phone, she throws water over her mother's photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son. When they meet Sailor, he reveals he will be leaving them both, having decided while in prison that he isn't good enough for them. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor encounters a gang who surround him. He insults them and they quickly knock him out. While unconscious, he sees a vision in the form of Glinda the Good Witch, who tells him, \"Don't turn away from love, Sailor\". When he awakens, he apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, then runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta in Lula's house sizzles and vanishes. As there is a traffic jam on the road, Sailor begins to run over the roofs and hoods of the cars to get back to Lula and their child in the car. Sailor sings \"Love Me Tender\" to Lula, having earlier said that he would only sing that song to his wife.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He killed a man who had attacked him"}],

Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign over his body for medical research following his execution. One year later, the automated Skynet system is activated, becomes self-aware, begins to perceive humans as a threat, and eradicates much of humanity with nuclear weapons in the event known as \"Judgment Day\".\nIn 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue (The T-800). He is the only survivor of the assault after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. Following Connor's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles, after taking the clothing from a Resistance soldier, who died in the explosion.\nJohn returns to Resistance headquarters, located aboard a nuclear submarine, and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his findings. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio signal believed to have been an order to shut down Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days; in response to an intercepted \"kill list\" created by Skynet with a plan to terminate the Resistance's command staff. John Connor learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and become his father. John returns to his base and meets with his pregnant wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his second-in-command Barnes (Common).\nArriving at the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus sees a T-600 Terminator and yells at it grasping its attention, but before Marcus is killed he is saved by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mute child named \"Star\" (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle then signs to Star and she sets off a trap for the T-600 that kills it off. After such, Kyle confronts Marcus with a gun and snaps at him about the blood red ribbon on his left arm (symboling Resistance). Marcus snags Kyle's weapon and points it at him instead asking of the year. Kyle tells Marcus about the war between humanity and Skynet and the year. After, Kyle takes Marcus to their base were Marcus finds a broken radio, he fixes it effortlessly and a broadcast appears on it, after hearing John's radio broadcast the three fall asleep. The three leave in search of others in the Resistance. They survive an attack at a gas station; yet Kyle, Star, and several other people are taken prisoner.\nLater, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) and they make their way to Connor's base, where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is, indeed, a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John thinks that Marcus has been sent to execute him and, orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets Marcus live.\nJohn pleads with the General to delay the offensive defense, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and, instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Marcus learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen) that he was created and built to lure John to this base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times before. The radio signal that the Resistance received is revealed to have been a ruse, and Skynet uses it, to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.\nMarcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator. Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John revives him, but John is mortally wounded during the fight. Marcus jumps the T-800 when it is distracted and defeats it, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together several Terminator fuel cells to explode and detonates them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too badly damaged. Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In response to a kill

Salvatore \"Sal\" Naturale (John Cazale), and Stevie (Gary Springer) attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve shortly after Sal pulls out his gun, and Sonny is forced to let him flee the scene. In the vault, Sonny discovers that he and Sal have arrived after the daily cash pickup, and only $1,100 in cash remains in the bank.\nTo compensate, Sonny takes a number of traveler's cheques, but his attempt to prevent the cheques from being traced by burning the bank's register in a trash can causes smoke to billow out the side of the building, alerting the business across the street to suspicious activities. Within minutes, the building is surrounded by the police. Unsure of what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage.\nPolice Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) calls the bank to tell Sonny that the police have arrived. Sonny warns that he and Sal have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries coming into the bank. Sal tells Sonny that he is ready to kill the hostages if necessary. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) monitors his actions.\nHoward Calvin (John Marriott), the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. Using head teller Sylvia \"The Mouth\" (Penelope Allen) as a shield, Sonny exits the bank and begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting \"Attica! Attica!\" (invoking the recent Attica Prison riot), and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.\nAfter realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands that a helicopter be landed on the roof to fly him and Sal out of the country. When they are informed that the asphalt roof of the bank will not support a helicopter, Sonny demands that a vehicle drive him and Sal to an airport so that they can board a jet. He also demands pizzas for the hostages (which are delivered to the scene) and that his wife be brought to the bank. When Sonny's wife, Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon), a pre-operative transsexual, arrives, she reveals to the crowd and officials one of Sonny's reasons for robbing the bank is to pay for Leon's sex reassignment surgery, and that Sonny also has an estranged divorced wife, Angie (Susan Peretz), and children.\nAs night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off. Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager, Mulvaney (Sully Boyar), goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor (Philip Charles MacKenzie) through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone.\nThe two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had attempted suicide to \"get away from\" Sonny. She had been hospitalized at the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital until the police brought her to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.\nAfter the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees. Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting that he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again. They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries persuading him to give himself up, and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in 10 minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance to Leon for her sex change and to Angie.\nWhen the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or booby traps. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy (Lance Henriksen) to drive Sonny, Sal, and the remaining hostages to Kennedy Airport. Per Sonny's earlier agreement, an additional hostage, Edna (Estelle Omens) is released, and the remaining hostages get into the limousine with Sonny and Sal. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him.\nAs they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, he again reminds Sal to aim his gun up so he does not fire by accident. Sal does so, and Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the terminal. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher. Subtitles reveal that Sonny was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Angie and her children subsisted on welfare, and Leon had her sex reassignment surgery.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Smoke from Sonny burning the bank register."}], "question": "What draws attention to the bank robbery?", "id": "121c28edd4b0474f2386d9290dcee15b5352e006"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Twenty years."}], "question": "How long is Sonny's prison sentence?", "id": "121c28edd4b0474f2386d9290dcee15b5352e006"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sex change surgery."}], "question": "What kind of surgery does Leon need?", "id": "121c28edd4b0474f2386d9290dcee15b5352e006"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The guard has an asthma attack."}], "question": "Why does Sonny release the security guard?", "id": "121c28edd4b0474f2386d9290dcee15b5352e006"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\"Attica!

Piper describes Bathurst in the story as \"a rather stout gentleman, of past middle age.\" However, the real Bathurst was born in 1784, and thus 25 years old at the time of his disappearance.\nThis story posits that Bathurst slipped into a parallel universe. This event was referenced in the Paratime story \"Police Operation\", also written by Piper. The point of divergence from our history is the Battle of Quebec on December 31, 1775 in which Benedict Arnold is killed instead of merely wounded, leading to the victory of British General John Burgoyne over his American counterpart Horatio Gates at the Battles of Saratoga on September 19 and October 7, 1777. Consequently, the American Revolution and the French Revolution were both failures and there were no Napoleonic Wars.\nThe alternate Bathurst served as the lieutenant governor of the Crown Colony of Georgia. Napoleon Bonaparte is a colonel in the French Army who is considered a brilliant tactician. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u0102\u0160rigord has remained in ecclesiastical orders and risen to become a Catholic Cardinal as well as Louis XVI's Chief Minister. George Washington was killed in battle at Doylestown, Pennsylvania during the short-lived rebellion of the colonies in British North America. Moreover, Thomas Jefferson - the author of the American rebels' Declaration of Philadelphia - fled to Havana and eventually died in the Principality of Liechtenstein several years prior to 1809, while James Madison is in exile in Switzerland. The Bathurst from our timeline is judged to be either insane, or a spy, and imprisoned. He attempts to escape and is fatally shot. There was also a theory that he was his counterpart's half-brother. However, it is noted that there is no evidence to support this.\nBathurst's diplomatic documents are read by a high ranking British officer. He is amused by Talleyrand's role as Bonaparte's advisor and \u0102\u0160minence grise, a role that he finds plausible. However, he is especially puzzled by references to a British general named \"Wellington.\" In the final line of the story, the British officer is revealed to be Sir Arthur Wellesley - known in our reality as the Duke of Wellington. He attained the title by way of his victories in the Napoleonic Wars, which never took place in this universe.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diplomat"}], "question": "What id Benjamin Bathurst's position?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "England"}], "question": "For which country is Benjamin a diplomat?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Prussia"}], "question": "Where is Benjamin when he disappears?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "25"}], "question": "How old was Bathurst when he disappeared?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Nepolianic War"}], "question": "In the parallel universe, what war did not occur?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is killed"}], "question": "What happens to Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Quebec in the alternate universe?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "lt governor"}], "question": "In the alternate universe, what position did Bathurst hold?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Crown Colony"}], "question": "In the alternate universe, which colony was Bathurst Lt Governor of?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Georgia"}], "question": "Which state is the Crown Colony in?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Nepolianic War"}], "question": "During which war did the Duke of Wellington attain victories, causing his to be given the title of Duke?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Benjamin Bathurst"}], "question": "Who is the main character of the story?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "25 Years old"}], "question": "How old was the real Benjamin Bathurst when he disappeared?", "id": "1288838955082c83ba4801ea8c7a0b0c157a3e3a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Battle of Quebec-on Dec 31, 1775"}], "question": "In the story it talks about the point of diveregence from our history.

Muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, and vows to return there to catch one alive. One day, Carl befriends a girl named Ellie, who is also a fan of Muntz. She confides to Carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094an abandoned house in the neighborhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls. Carl and Ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house. Carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo Ellie opens. After suffering a miscarriage and being told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They try to save for the trip, but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. Finally, an elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies.\nYears later, Carl still lives in the house, stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction, but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox, a court orders him to move to a retirement home. However, Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and turns his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer, becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly. After surviving a thunderstorm, the flying house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, whom he names \"Kevin\". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master.\nThe group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a doberman (who is also seeking the bird), and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they have been attempting to steal the bird. The pair flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz catches up with them, captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. Carl rushes to put out the fire, allowing Muntz to take the bird. He and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is disappointed in Carl over his decision to abandon Kevin.\nSettling into his home, Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging him to go have a new one. Reinvigorated, he goes to find Russell, only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save Kevin on his own. Carl empties the house of furniture and possessions, lightening it, and pursues him. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and Kevin. Dug accidentally defeats Alpha and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, finally cornering Dug, Kevin, and Russell inside Carl's tethered house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship with Dug and Russell clinging to her back, but when Muntz leaps after them, he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks, then fly the dirigible back to the city. Carl presents Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met and made their promise. The two and Dug then enjoy some ice cream together.

Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes. He buys a chaise to continue his journey. The next town he visits is Montreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur.\nDuring his stay in Paris, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France (Sterne traveled to Paris in January 1762, before the Seven Years' War ended), he risks imprisonment in the Bastille. Yorick decides to travel to Versailles where he visits the Count de B**** to acquire a passport. When Yorick notices the count reads Hamlet, he points with his finger at Yorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.\nYorick returns to Paris, and continues his voyage to Italy after staying in Paris for a few more days. Along the way he decides to visit Maria\u00e2\u0080\u0094who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel, Tristram Shandy\u00e2\u0080\u0094in Moulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.\nAfter having passed Lyon during his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. Because there is only one bedroom, he is forced to share the room with a lady and her chamber-maid (\"fille de chambre\"). When Yorick can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during the night, an altercation with the lady ensues. During the confusion, Yorick accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to the chamber-maid. The last line is: \"when I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre's...End of vol II\". The sentence is open to interpretation. You can say the last word is omitted, or that he stretched out his hand, and caught hers (this would be grammatically correct). Another interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into the sentence, so that he grabs the Fille de Chambre's 'End'.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Calais."}], "question": "In what city does Yorick begin his travels?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A snuff-box."}], "question": "What does Yorick trade with the monk in Calais?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is a servant who will join Yorick on his travels."}], "question": "Who is La Fleur to Yorick?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He does not have a passport and could be imprisoned."}], "question": "Why is Yorick concerned when the police show up at his hotel in Paris?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A copy of Hamlet."}], "question": "What does Yorick use to attempt to identify himself to the Count?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Maria?"}], "question": "Who does Yorick decide to visit on his way to Italy?", "id": "14fc0de61e9e8044764da1fb9f647d8ceb60e561"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Her husband died.

Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife Margaret's (Holly Hunter) apparent Tourette Syndrome, he stages a disfiguring animal attack with the body in order to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required.\nLocal police are convinced, but promotion-hungry insurance agent Ted Waters (Giovanni Ribisi) is not. The hitmen who dumped the body are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Margaret hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Meanwhile, Ted is having problems with his girlfriend, Tiffany (Alison Lohman), who he neglects as he works his way up in his firm.\nPaul's missing brother Raymond (Woody Harrelson) returns home, beats him up, and demands a portion of the insurance money. By suggesting that Ted assaulted him, Paul speeds up the delivery of the million dollar insurance payment. He has the body exhumed and agrees to exchange it and a portion of the money for Margaret. Fearing that Raymond will attempt to kill Margaret to keep her quiet, Paul considers killing his brother in his sleep, but cannot bring himself to do so.\nThe next morning Paul leaves his brother asleep and meets the hit-men for the exchange. Raymond is angered at his brother's deception and arrives as well, and is told by the insurance agent, who has finally pieced together what has happened, about his million dollar policy. Raymond then pulls out a pistol and shoots Margaret in the back as she flees. He is in turn shot in the stomach by one of the hit-men (Tim Nelson). Paul finds Margaret alive; he had hidden the insurance money in her jacket, and it stopped the bullet. The brothers say goodbye as Raymond dies. Paul tells Ted that he only committed fraud out of love for his wife, which appeals to Ted's renewed feelings for Tiffany; touched, he lets them go. Using the money, Paul takes Margaret on a tropical vacation.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Travel agent"}], "question": "What is Paul Barnell's occupation?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A body"}], "question": "What does Paul find in a dumpster?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mafia hitmen"}], "question": "Who was responsible for putting the body in the dumpster?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tourette Syndrome"}], "question": "What does Margaret medically suffer from?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cash from his life insurance policy"}], "question": "What does Paul wish to inherit from his missing brother?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Insurance agent"}], "question": "What is Ted Waters' occupation?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Margaret"}], "question": "Who do the mafia hitmen take hostage?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Raymond"}], "question": "Who beats up Paul?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A portion of the insurance money"}], "question": "What does Raymond demand from Paul?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Takes her on a tropical vacation"}], "question": "What does Paul end up doing for Margaret with the insurance money?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Body"}], "question": "What did travel agent Paul Barnell found in a dumpster?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mafia hitmen"}], "question": "Who was responsible for the body found the travel agent?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tourette Syndrome"}], "question": "Paul Barnell's wife is suffering from what kind of illness?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "For proof to collect their payment."}], "question": "Why do Mafia hitmen want to get the corpse?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They took Margaret as their hostage."}], "question": "What did the Mafia hitmen do to make sure they will get the body?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They used it on a tropical vacation."}], "question": "How did Paul and Margaret use the money?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He did it out of love for his wife."}], "question": "For what purpose Paul committed fraud?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The insurance money that she placed in her jacket."}], "question": "Margaret was saved from getting killed by which item that stopped the bullet?", "id": "1528f4c003dde308ae74bdec458466765944ca6a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "One of the hit-men.

His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt). Walter's apartment is just across the street from an elementary school\u00e2\u0080\u0094an obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying \"I didn't hurt them.\" Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment.\nWalter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas (Mos Def). Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames \"Candy\" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious co-worker, Mary-Kay (Eve), learns of his conviction and alerts the entire mill. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense.\nOstracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father. In her anguish, and sensing a similarity between her father and Walter, she offers to sit on Walter's lap, wanting his approval. Walter finally understands the pain he caused his victims, and tells Robin to go home; as she leaves, she gives him a hug. On his way home, he sees Candy dropping off a young boy near the school at night. In a fit of rage and self-hatred, Walter gives Candy a thorough beating. Afterwards, he goes to Vicki's home, and she accepts him.\nSoon after, Lucas visits Walter's apartment as Walter is packing to move in with Vicki and tells him that a man was beaten across the street the night before, and asks if he knows anything about it. Walter denies any knowledge, but Lucas knows better. He reveals that the boy gave a very good description of the assailant, which fits Walter. He also reveals that \"Candy\" is wanted in Virginia for raping a young boy. Lucas decides not to charge Walter with the assault. With Carlos' help, Walter is reunited with his sister, whom he has not seen in years. However, she refuses to forgive him and leaves.

There were significant changes between the 1928 magazine publication and the 1946 hardcover, and between the early hardcovers and the late 1950s and later paperback editions.\nThe Skylark of Space is the first book of the Skylark series and pits the idealistic protagonist, Dick Seaton, against the mercantile antagonist Marc \"Blackie\" DuQuesne.\nAt the beginning of the story, Seaton accidentally discovers a workable space drive in combining pure copper with a newly discovered [fictional] element \"X\" (suggested to be a stable transactinide element in the platinum group) in solution. Having failed to re-create the effect, Seaton realizes that the missing component is a field generated by DuQuesne's particle accelerator, and thereafter sets up a business with his millionaire friend, Martin Crane, to build a spaceship. DuQuesne conspires to sabotage Seaton's spaceship and build his own from Seaton's plans, which he uses to kidnap Seaton's fianc\u00e9e, Dorothy Vaneman, to exchange for the \"X\". In the resulting fight, DuQuesne's ship is accidentally set to full acceleration on an uncontrolled trajectory, until the copper 'power bar' is exhausted at a vast distance from Earth's solar system. Using an \"Object Compass\" that once locked on an object, always points toward that object, Seaton and Crane follow DuQuesne in their own spaceship (the eponymous Skylark) to rescue Dorothy and her fellow-hostage, Margaret \"Peg\" Spencer, until the Skylark discovers DuQuesne's ship derelict in orbit around a massive dead star (resembling a cold neutron star). Having obtained the hostages, Seaton extracts a promise from DuQuesne to \"act as one of the party until they get back to Earth\", in which relationship they leave orbit and travel further in search of additional fuel.\nOn an Earthlike exoplanet, they obtain \"X\" from an outcrop almost purely of that mineral; then leave that planet in search of copper. Following an encounter with a \"Disembodied Intelligence\" (Star Trek's \"Q\" would later show similar attributes), they enter a cluster of stars nicknamed \u201cThe Green System\u201d and locate a planet having copper sulfate oceans. On the Earth-like \"Osnome\", they befriend the rulers of Mardonale, one of the two factions of the Osnomian natives. When the Mardonalian ruler attempts to betray Seaton and his friends, they find allies in Prince Dunark (a crown-prince of Mardonale's rival \"Kondal\") and his consort Princess Sitar, whom they later assist in destroying Mardonale. In gratitude, the Kondalians make new copper \"power bars\" and rebuild the Skylark as Skylark Two, with new weapons known to Kondalian science. Thereafter Seaton's marriage to Dorothy, and Crane's to Margaret, are solemnized by the Kondalian monarchy, and Seaton himself declared nominal \"Overlord\" of Kondal. The Skylark then returns to Earth, laden with jewels, platinum, radium, and a plenitude of \"X\"; but near Earth, DuQuesne leaves the Skylark by parachute, and the story ends with the Skylark's landing on Crane's Field.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marc DuQuesne"}], "question": "Who kidnaps Dorothy Vaneman?", "id": "15b1a5fe8ab222deba12f514f8a2311f901ab1d2"},

But he was framed for jury tampering some years back by the firm's senior partner because he was going to expose their corrupt practices. The firm fired him and his marriage ended in divorce. Although he retains his license to practice law, Frank has become an alcoholic ambulance chaser who has had only four cases over the last three years, all of which he has lost.\nAs a favor, his former teacher and friend Mickey (Jack Warden) sends him a medical malpractice case in which it is all but assured that the defense will settle for a large amount. The case involves a young woman who was given an anesthetic during childbirth, after which she choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen. The young woman is now comatose and on a respirator. Her sister and brother-in-law are hoping for a monetary award in order to give her proper care. Frank assures them they have a strong case. Meanwhile, Frank, who is lonely, becomes romantically involved with Laura (Charlotte Rampling), a woman he meets at a local bar.\nFrank visits the comatose woman and is deeply affected. He then meets with the bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston (Edward Binns), which owns the Catholic hospital where the incident took place. As expected, the bishop's representative offers a substantial amount of money \u2013 $210,000 \u2013 to settle out of court, but Frank declines the offer as he fears that this may be his last chance to do something right as a lawyer, and that merely taking the handout would render him \"lost\". Everyone, including the presiding judge and the victim's relatives, is stunned by Frank's decision (Frank fails to communicate the offer to his client's family before rejecting it).\nThings quickly go wrong for Frank: his client's brother-in-law finds out from \"the other side\" that he has turned down the $210,000, and angrily confronts Frank; his star medical expert disappears; a hastily arranged substitute's credentials and testimony are called into serious question on the witness stand. His opponent, the high-priced attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason), has at his disposal a large legal team that is masterful with the press; the presiding judge (Milo O'Shea) makes deliberate efforts to obstruct Frank's questioning of his expert; and no one who was in the operating room is willing to testify that there was any negligence.\nFrank's big break comes when he discovers that Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse), the nurse who admitted his client to the hospital, is now a preschool teacher in New York. Frank travels there to track her down, leaving Mickey and Laura working together in Frank's Boston office. Frank confronts Costello, asking, \"Will you help me?\"\nMeanwhile in Boston, Mickey is looking for cigarettes in Laura's handbag and discovers a check from Concannon's law firm. He infers that she is a mole, providing information on their legal strategy to the opposing lawyers.\nMickey flies to New York to tell Frank that Laura has been betraying them. He suggests to Frank that it would be easy to get the case declared a mistrial, but Frank decides to continue. Shortly thereafter, Frank meets Laura, who has also traveled to New York. In a display of cold fury, Frank strikes her in the face, knocking her to the floor.\nCostello testifies that, shortly after the patient had become comatose, the anesthesiologist (one of the two doctors on trial, along with the archdiocese of Boston) told her to change her notes on the admitting form to hide his fatal error. She had written down that the patient had had a full meal only one hour before being admitted. The doctor had failed to read the admitting notes. Thus, in ignorance, he gave her an anesthetic that should never be given to a patient with a full stomach. As a result, the patient vomited and choked.\nCostello further testifies that, when the anesthesiologist realized his mistake, he met with Costello in private and forced her to change the number \"1\" to the number \"9\" on her admitting notes. But Costello made a photocopy of the notes before she made the change, which she brought with her to court. She was subsequently fired, leading her to exclaim in court, \"Who are these men? I wanted to be a nurse!\" But Concannon quickly turns the situation around by getting the judge to declare the nurse's testimony stricken from the record on technicalities. Feeling that his case is hopeless, Frank gives a brief but passionate closing argument, telling the jury \"you are the law\" and entreating them to seek \"truth and justice\" in their hearts before they vote.\nIn the penultimate scene, the jury \u2013 apparently disregarding the judge's instructions to ignore the nurse's testimony \u2013 announces that they have found in favor of Frank's clients. As Frank, Mickey, and Frank's clients quietly rejoice, the foreman asks the judge whether the jury can award more than the amount the plaintiffs sought. The judge resignedly replies that they can, but the amount they decide on is not revealed. As Frank is congratulated by his clients, Mickey, and colleagues and strangers alike, he catches a glimpse of Laura watching him across the atrium.\nOne night, Laura, in a drunken stupor on her bed, drops her whiskey on the floor, drags the phone toward her, and puts in a call to Frank. As the phone rings, Frank sits in his office with a cup of coffee. He moves to answer it, but ultimately decides not to. The film ends with the phone continuing to ring.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "210,000 dollars"}], "question": "How much money did Frank turn down for the out of court settlement?", "id": "15f500761e9b3001810b088339b99ec7de656a2a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Micky, Frank's old teacher."}], "question": "Who gives Frank the case?", "id": "15f500761e9b3001810b088339b99ec7de656a2a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Boston college Law school"}], "question": "Where did Frank graduate from?", "id": "15f500761e9b3001810b088339b99ec7de656a2a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jury tampering"}], "question": "What was Frank framed for by the law firms senior partner?", "id": "15f500761e9b3001810b088339b99ec7de656a2a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Costello"}], "question": "Who is the nurse that testifies?", "id": "15f500761e9b3001810b088339b99ec7de656a2a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He found out that she was a mole for the other law firm.

At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying \"Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)\" and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the finger.\nThe scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a Certified Circumcised Dick who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.\nThe fight takes them to exotic locales such as Israel, K-Mart, the North Pole and the final battle at the Israeli atomic clock.",

The town's name refers to the philosopher Socrates and his ideas about internal and external beauty. It tells the story of Marianela (sometimes referred to as \"Nela\"), a poor orphan girl with an ugly face, and her love for Pablo, a blind boy, who has feelings for Nela as well. Marianela frequently sings to Pablo, and he believes she is beautiful because of her voice. Pablo's father asks a famous doctor, named Teodoro Golfin, to come and examine Pedro to see if his sight can be restored. Pablo, full of hope at the prospect, promises La Nela that he will marry her after the operation if it is successful. He is convinced that La Nela is beautiful, even when she tells him otherwise. In the meantime, Pablo's father plans for Pablo to marry his beautiful cousin, Florentina, but tells neither of them about it. Florentina comes to Socartes and when Marianela first sees her, she mistakes her for the Virgin Mary because of her beauty. When Florentina is out walking with Pablo and Marianela, she expresses her pity for La Nela because she is poor, abandoned and nobody loves her. She vows to take charge of Nela and clothe, educate her, and have La Nela live with her like a sister.\nPablo eventually gets the operation that gives him his sight. Before seeing Nela, he sees Florentina and proposes to her instead. Because of this, Nela attempts suicide but is saved by Teodoro Golf\u0102\u00adn, the eye doctor who cured Pedro. He and Florentina take Nela to Pablo's villa and take care of her while she is hiding away from Pablo because of her looks. Then, due to Pablo's desire to see her, Pablo finds his way to La Nela's room and serenades Florentina.

From here the two diverge: The Scarlet Citadel, a short story, ends with Conan coming back when the rioting just started and making short work of his foes; in the book-length Hour of the Dragon it is much more complicated, Aquilonia has to live under a long and harrowing foreign occupation while Conan goes through a long hazardous quest, before he could finally come back and dispose of his foes.\nThe book place when Conan is about forty-five, during his reign as King of Aquilonia, and follows a plot by a group of conspirators to depose him in favor of Valerius, heir to Conan's predecessor Numedides, whom he had slain to gain the throne. To accomplish this they resort to necromancy, resurrecting Xaltotun, an ancient sorcerer from the pre-Hyborian empire of Acheron.

The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.\nIn the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\nThor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.\nLoki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifr\u00f6st\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\nIn a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power.

The head of the school gives Landon the choice of being expelled or atoning for his actions by tutoring fellow students and participating in the school play. During these functions, Landon notices Jamie Sullivan, a girl he has known since kindergarten and who has attended many of the same classes as him, and is also the local minister's daughter. Since he's one of the in-crowd, he has seldom paid any attention to Jamie, who wears modest dresses and owns only one sweater. Jamie is labeled an outsider and a geek. She makes no attempt to wear make-up or otherwise improve her looks or attract attention to herself.\nLandon has trouble learning his lines for the play. Jamie, who is also in the play, agrees to help him on one condition: Jamie warns Landon not to fall in love with her; he laughs it off and dismisses it as a foolish idea. Landon and Jamie begin practicing together at her house after school. They get to know each other and a spark of affection arises between them.\nOn the opening night of the play, Jamie astounds Landon and the entire audience with her beauty and her voice. Onstage at the peak of the ending to the play, Jamie sings. When Jamie finishes, Landon improvises and kisses her which is not a part of the play. Afterwards, Jamie avoids Landon, and it is not until Landon's friends play a cruel prank on Jamie and he protects her in opposition to his friends that she warms up to him again. Landon asks Jamie on a date soon after, but Jamie says her father doesn't allow her to date. Landon asks her father if he can date his daughter, bringing up that he's looking for a chance at redemption with her and at life through her. Reluctant at first, he gives in.\nOn their first date, Landon helps Jamie to fulfill her list of things she wants to achieve in life, such as being in two places at once, and getting a tattoo. After that, they go to the docks. Jamie tells Landon about how she experiences belief and how it's like the wind. It is then that he tells her he might want to kiss her now. On another date, where Jamie is very silent and unfocused, Landon asks Jamie what her plans for the future are. She then confesses she isn't making any because she has leukemia and hasn't been responding to treatment. A desperate Landon asks for his father's help in curing her, but is disappointed by his reply and heads on a long drive home thinking about Jamie.\nOne by one, his friends become aware of the tragedy looming for Jamie and Landon. They give their support to him. Jamie's condition grows worse and she gets sent to the hospital. While in the hospital, Jamie gives Landon a book that once belonged to her mother. She states that maybe God sent Landon to her to help her through the rough times and that Landon is her angel. Unbeknownst to Landon, Jamie is given private home care by Landon's estranged father, relieving her father's financial burden. Landon visits his dad, tearfully thanking him for his help. They embrace and are reunited.\nLandon is building a telescope for Jamie to be able to see a one-time comet in the springtime. Jamie's father helps him get it finished in time. The telescope is brought to her on the balcony. She gets a beautiful view of the comet through the new telescope. It is then that Landon asks her to marry him. Jamie tearfully accepts, and they get married in the church in which her deceased mother got married. Jamie and Landon spend their last summer together, filled with a deep love like no other. Jamie dies when summer ends.\nFour years later, Landon has finished college and been accepted into medical school. Landon visits Reverend Sullivan to return to him Jamie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precious book that belonged to her mother. Landon apologizes to the Reverend that Jamie did not witness a miracle (an ambition she expressed in the class yearbook). The Reverend disagrees saying that in fact she did and that her miracle was Landon. He is shown to have completely changed his original opinion of Landon in the beginning of the film, where he completely detested Landon and did not hide it.\nLandon visits the docks contemplating the belief that although Jamie is dead, that she is with him. It is then that he understands love is like the wind; you can't see it, but you can feel it.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "For drinking while underage."}], "question": "Why is

Williams) is the host of \"The Rainbow Randolph Show\", a popular children's television series broadcast on the fictional network Kidnet. Despite his friendly appearance on-stage, off-stage he is a corrupt and alcoholic businessman who secretly accepts bribes from parents who want to put their kids on his show. After an FBI sting exposes him, Randolph is fired and his show is cancelled. He is also kicked out of his corporate penthouse and loses all of his money, leaving him homeless, unemployed, and broke. Kidnet replaces Randolph with the \"squeaky clean\" Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton) and his character, Smoochy the Rhino. Mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality child entertainment, and despite doubts from his hardened producer Nora Wells (Catherine Keener), his show quickly becomes tremendously popular. Meanwhile, Randolph turns to his former associate Marion \"Frank\" Stokes (Jon Stewart) and pleads to help him get his job back, but Stokes refuses, saying that he can't even be seen talking to Randolph. Randolph then turns to his former partner Angelo Pike (Danny Woodburn) and asks him to stay at his apartment, to which Angelo reluctantly agrees.\nMopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to Nora and with the help of his new agent Burke Bennett (Danny DeVito), Mopes renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer. Irish mob boss Tommy Cotter (Pam Ferris) approaches Mopes and asks him to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner Dunn (Michael Rispoli), a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with brain damage. Mopes reluctantly adds Spinner to the show, first as a cowbell-wielding game warden, and later on as Smoochy's cousin Moochy.\nMopes is horrified to learn that Burke has signed him up to star in a Smoochy ice show, as he fears that the event will exploit children. Burke and Merv Green (Harvey Fierstein), the head of the corrupt charity running the ice show, warn Mopes not to back out of the event but he does so anyway. Soon afterward, a disguised Randolph tricks Mopes into performing a Smoochy act at a neo-Nazi rally that is raided by the police. Mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show. However, when Randolph barges into Nora's apartment and tries to convince her to help him get his job back, he accidentally reveals that he set Mopes up. Tommy and her crew then barge into Angelo's apartment and force Randolph to confess that he tricked Sheldon before beating him up and turning him over to the police. As a result, Smoochy's reputation and show are restored and Randolph is dubbed the most hated man in America by the media. To make matters worse, Angelo kicks Randolph out of his apartment after he smashes his TV in a fit of rage. After telling him that his show is back on the air, Nora kisses Mopes and has sex with him, starting a relationship.\nMopes then decides to perform in an ice show, but rather than involve the corrupt charities, he decides that half the proceeds of the ice show should go to the drug rehabilitation clinic where he used to work while the other half to child literacy enhancement programs. Also, the children who attend the show will be given free souvenirs and healthy snacks. Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. However, their plan backfires when during a rehearsal, Green's men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Mopes and murder him. When Tommy and her men get word of his death, they retaliate by killing Green and his men. Meanwhile, Randolph corners Mopes and Nora in their penthouse and threatens to kill them. Randolph reveals to Sheldon that Nora has had affairs with numerous children's show hosts, including Randolph himself. Sheldon is hurt by this, but Nora insists that she has genuine feelings for him. They manage to talk Randolph down and discover that he is depressed and genuinely misses entertaining children. Randolph has a change of heart and an empathetic Sheldon offers to let him stay in the penthouse until he recovers.\nBurke and Stokes decide to partner up after hearing of Green's death. They hire Buggy Ding Dong (Vincent Schiavelli), another former kid show host who became a heroin addict, to assassinate Mopes during his ice show. Buggy steals a backstage pass to get inside, but before he can shoot Mopes he is confronted by Randolph. They struggle for the sniper rifle until Buggy falls to his death in the ice rink. After Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up, he chases Burke into an alley. Mopes pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke, but Tommy and her men arrive and persuade him not to forfeit his high ideals. Tommy decides to take care of Burke and Stokes in her own way, Mopes and Nora share a kiss in Times Square and the movie ends with Smoochy and Randolph launching a new show together.", "qas":

divorced. He feels good about the results of an initial session with Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), a New York psychoanalytical psychiatrist with a huge ego, but is immediately left on his own with a copy of Leo's new book, Baby Steps, when the doctor goes on vacation to Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire for a month. Unable to cope, Bob follows Leo to his vacation home. Leo is annoyed because he does not see patients on vacation but, seeing how desperate Bob is, he gives Bob a prescription telling him to \"take a vacation from his problems.\" Bob seems to have made a breakthrough, but the next morning shows up at Leo's house again and says that he decided to take a vacation both in spirit and in fact. He is staying on at Lake Winnipesaukee as a guest of the Guttmans, a couple who own a coffee shop and are more than happy to have Bob as their guest and encourage him to be around Leo, as they hold a grudge against Dr. Marvin for purchasing the lakeside home they had been scrimping and saving for years to buy.\nBob suggests that they start a friendship, although Leo thinks being friends with a patient is beneath him and attempts to avoid any further contact. However, Bob swiftly ingratiates himself with Leo's family, who think Bob may have some foibles, but is otherwise a balanced and sociable man. Leo's children: Anna (Kathryn Erbe) and Sigmund (Charlie Korsmo) find that Bob relates well to their problems, in contrast with their father's clinical approach, while Bob begins to gain an enjoyment of life from his association with them. Bob goes sailing with Anna and helps Sigmund to dive into the lake, which Leo was unable to help him with. Leo then angrily pushes Bob into the lake and Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, Fay, insists on inviting Bob to dinner to apologize, which Bob accepts (as he views Leo's slights against him as accidental and/or part of his therapy). At dinner, Bob's comment on Baby Steps causes Leo to choke, and Bob saves his life by repeatedly and violently landing his full weight on the doctor's prostrated form. A thunderstorm then forces Bob to spend the night. Leo wants Bob out of the house by 6:30, as Good Morning America is arriving at 7 to interview him about Baby Steps. The next morning, however, the television crew shows up early and, oblivious to Leo's discomfort, suggest having Bob on the show as well. Leo is tense and makes a fool out of himself during the interview while Bob is relaxed and speaks glowingly of Leo and the book, unintentionally stealing the spotlight.\nOutraged, Leo throws a tantrum and then attempts to have Bob committed, but Bob is soon released after telling the staff of the institution therapy jokes, easily demonstrating his sanity. Forced to retrieve him, Leo then abandons Bob in the middle of nowhere, but Bob quickly gets a ride back to Leo's house while a variety of mishaps delay Leo until nightfall. Leo is then surprised by the birthday party that Fay has been secretly planning for him, and he is delighted to see his beloved sister Lily. But when Bob appears and puts his arm around Lily, Leo becomes completely enraged and attacks him. Bob remains oblivious to Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hostility, but Fay explains that Leo has been acting unacceptably as a result of an inexplicable grudge against Bob, and he agrees to leave. Meanwhile, Leo breaks into the town's general store, stealing a shotgun and 20 pounds of explosives. Bob becomes terrified while walking through the dark woods and is kidnapped at gunpoint by Leo, who leads him deep into the woods, ties him up, and straps the explosives onto him, calling it \"death therapy.\" Leo then returns to the house, gleefully preparing his cover story. Believing the explosives to be props and used as a metaphor for his problems, Bob applies Leo's \"Baby Steps\" approach and manages to free himself both of his physical restraints and his fears; he reunites with Leo and his family, praising Leo for curing him with \"death therapy.\" A frantic Leo asks Bob where he put the black powder, to which Bob replies \"in the house\" just before the Marvins' vacation home detonates. The shock leaves Leo in a catatonic state.\nSome time later, the still-catatonic Leo is brought to Bob and Lily's wedding. Upon their pronouncement as husband and wife, Leo regains his senses and screams, \"No!\" but the sentiment is lost in the family's excitement at his recovery. Text at the end reveals that Bob went back to school and became a psychologist, then wrote a best selling book titled Death Therapy, and that Leo is suing him for the rights.", "qas": [{"answers":

then destroy the Earth using natural disasters. On Earth, New York Jets football star \"Flash\" Gordon boards a small plane, where he meets travel journalist Dale Arden. Mid-flight, the cockpit is hit by a meteorite and the pilots are lost. Flash takes control and manages to crash land into a greenhouse owned by Dr. Hans Zarkov. Zarkov, who believes the disasters are being caused because an unknown source is pushing the Moon towards Earth, has secretly constructed a spacecraft which he plans to use to investigate. Zarkov's assistant refuses to go, so he lures Flash and Dale aboard. The rocket launches, taking them to the planet Mongo, where they are captured by Ming's troops.\nThe three are brought before Ming. He orders Dale be prepared for his pleasure. Flash tries to resist, but is overpowered. Ming orders Zarkov be reprogrammed and Flash executed. Ming's daughter, Princess Aura, seduces Ming's surgeon into saving Flash, to whom she is attracted. As they escape, Flash sees Zarkov being brainwashed by Klytus, the metal-faced head of the secret police. Aura and Flash flee to Arboria, kingdom of Prince Barin, Aura's lover. En route, Aura teaches Flash to use a telepathic communicator to contact Dale. He lets her know he is alive. Dale is locked in Ming's bedchamber, but encouraged by Flash, she escapes. Klytus sends Zarkov to intercept Dale, who tells him and Klytus that Flash is alive. They then escape, as Zarkov reveals he resisted the brainwashing. They are captured by Prince Vultan's Hawkmen and taken to Sky City.\nAura and Flash arrive at Arboria. Aura asks the Prince to keep Flash safe. A distrustful Barin, in love with Aura, agrees not to kill Flash, but then forces him to perform a deadly ritual. Barin and Flash take turns sticking their hands into a hollow stump with a giant scorpion-like Wood Beast inside. When Flash has to take an extra turn, he pretends to be stung as a distraction and escapes. Barin follows, but they are both captured by the Hawkmen.\nKlytus informs Ming that Flash is alive and is given authority to find out who is responsible. Aura returns and is taken prisoner and tortured by Klytus and General Kala. They force her to confess and Ming banishes her to the ice moon Frigia after his wedding. Meanwhile, Flash and Barin are taken to Sky City, where Flash and Dale are briefly reunited. Flash is forced to fight Barin to the death, but Barin joins him when Flash saves his life. Klytus arrives and Flash and Barin kill him. Knowing that this will bring retribution, Vultan orders the Hawkmen to evacuate, leaving Barin, Flash, Dale and Zarkov behind. Ming's ship arrives and he orders Barin, Zarkov and Dale to be taken aboard. Ming is impressed with Flash, and offers him lordship over Earth in exchange for loyalty, which Flash refuses. Ming gives the order to destroy Vultan's kingdom along with Flash. Flash finds a rocket cycle and escapes before Sky City is destroyed.\nFlash contacts Vultan, who is hiding on Arboria and they plot an attack on Mingo City. Flash pretends to attack Mingo City alone on his rocket cycle. General Kala dispatches the war rocket Ajax to kill Flash, but the Hawkmen ambush and seize the rocket. Meanwhile, Princess Aura overpowers her guard and frees Barin and Zarkov from the execution chamber. Flash and the Hawkmen attack Mingo City in Ajax and Kala activates the defenses, as Ming and Dale's wedding begins. Mingo City's lightning field can only be penetrated by flying Ajax into it at a suicidal speed. Flash volunteers to stay at the helm to ensure success and allow the Hawkmen to invade the city.\nBarin and Zarkov enter the control room to stop the lightning field, encountering Kala who refuses to deactivate it. She attempts to kill Zarkov, but Barin shoots and kills her. Without Kala they are unable to deactivate the field from that control room. Barin tells Zarkov to hold the fort while he heads to Sector Alpha 9. Zarkov keeps trying, but is unable to deactivate the shield.\nBarin fights through Ming's guards and gets to Sector Alpha and deactivates the lightning field before Ajax hits it. Flash flies the rocket ship into the city's wedding hall and the ship's bow impales Ming. He falls off the rocket nose, seriously wounded and Flash offers to spare his life if he will stop the attack on Earth, but Ming refuses. Ming attempts to use his power ring on Flash, but his power falters and nothing happens. He then aims the ring at himself and is seemingly vaporized by its remaining power seconds before the counter to the destruction of the Earth reaches zero. A huge victory celebration ensues.\nBarin and Aura become the new leaders in Ming's place. Barin names Vultan the leader of their armies. Flash, Dale, and Zarkov discuss returning to Earth. Zarkov says he doesn't know how they will get back, but they will try. Barin tells them all they're welcome to stay, but Dale says she's a New York City girl, and it's now too quiet around Mongo.\nThe final frame shows Ming's ring being picked up by the hand of an unseen person. Ming's laugh echoes as the credits roll.

Their cell is in the tower of Theseus's castle, with a window which overlooks his palace garden. The imprisoned Palamon wakes early one morning in May and catches sight of Princess Emily (Emelye), the sister of Theseus's wife Hippolyta, down in the courtyard picking flowers for a garland. He instantly falls in love with her; his moan is heard by Arcite, who then also wakes and sees Emily. He falls in love with her as well, claiming that, because Palamon first recognized Emily as mortal and not as a goddess, Arcite alone has the right to woo her.\nThe competition brought about by this love causes them to fight one another. After some years, Arcite is released from prison through the good offices of Theseus's friend Pirithoos, amending Arcite's sentence to exile. Arcite secretly returns to Athens in disguise and enters service in Emily's household to get close to her. Palamon eventually escapes by drugging the jailer and, while hiding in a grove, overhears Arcite singing about love and fortune.\nThey begin to duel with each other over who should get Emily, but are thwarted by the arrival of Theseus, who sentences them both to gather 100 men apiece and to fight a mass judicial tournament, the winner of which is to marry Emily. The forces assemble. Palamon prays to Venus to make Emily his wife; Emily prays to Diana to remain unmarried, or else to marry the one who truly loves her; and Arcite prays to Mars for victory. Theseus lays down rules for the tournament so that, if any man becomes seriously injured, he must be dragged out of the battle and is no longer in combat. Because of this, the story seems to claim at the end that there were almost no deaths on either side.\nBoth Palamon and Arcite fight valiantly, but Palamon is wounded by a sword thrust from one of Arcite's men and is unhorsed. Theseus declares the fight to be over and Arcite thus wins the battle. But before he can claim Emily as his prize, through a divine intervention by Saturn, he is mortally injured by his horse throwing him off and then falling on him. As he dies, he tells Emily that she should marry Palamon, because he would make a good husband for her. Palamon marries Emily, and thus all three prayers are fulfilled.Theseus begins with a reference to the First Mover, the primum movens, or unmoved mover of Aristotelian philosophy creating the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Chain of Love\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the kyndely enclyning, or natural inclination, that holds the universe together in Medieval cosmology. He describes the inevitability of death for all things at their proper time, using the destruction of an oak tree, a stone, and a river as examples, and listing all the classes of medieval society as universally subject to death. He then shifts to a discussion of the proper way to respond to this inevitability of death. Theseus maintains that, since every man must die when his time comes, that it is best to die with a good name and reputation, on good terms with his friends, and having died with honour. Theseus's comfort to Emily and Palamon is that Arcite died in just such a manner, having acquitted himself well in a feat of arms.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arcite, after Palamon is injured."}], "question": "Who did Theseus declare to be the winner?", "id": "1b548ec72908f9447446bdb24e8c179df19a8999"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Saturn."}], "question": "Who intervenes to kill Arcite?", "id": "1b548ec72908f9447446bdb24e8c179df19a8999"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Emily (or, Emeleye)"}], "question": "What is the name of the woman Palamon and Arcite fight over?

Plume arrives, in love with Sylvia, closely followed by Worthy, a local gentleman who is in love with Sylvia's cousin Melinda. Worthy asked Melinda to become his mistress a year previously, as he believed her to be of inadequate fortune to marry. But he changes his mind after she comes into an inheritance of \u00c2\u014120,000. Melinda accepts an invitation from Captain Brazen, another recruiter, to annoy Worthy, as she was offended by Worthy's previous offer. However, her maid Lucy meets Brazen, pretending to be Melinda, hoping to marry him herself. Melinda and Sylvia argue after Melinda says that the money she has inherited makes her more desirable. Silvia, who is more down to earth, is infuriated by Melinda's newly haughty behaviour.\nSylvia leaves her father's house to mourn her brother Owen's death. She tells her father Balance that she is going to the Welsh countryside but in fact goes into Shrewsbury dressed as a man, under the name 'Jack Wilful'. There Brazen and Plume compete to recruit 'Wilful', unaware of 'his' real identity. Kite abducts 'him' for Plume while Plume duels with Brazen. Still disguised as Wilful, Sylvia goes on to spend the night in bed with Rose, a local wench previously courted by Plume to get Rose's brother Bullock to join up. An action is brought against 'Wilful' for sexually assaulting Rose and 'he' finds 'himself' on trial before Sylvia's father Balance and his two fellow magistrates Scruple and Scale. The three magistrates also look into Kite's dubious recruiting practices but finally acquit him and force Wilful to swear to the Articles of War.\nMeanwhile Melinda continues to discourage Worthy, until going to a fortune teller (in fact Kite in disguise), where she is convinced to relent and accept his courtship. She is also tricked by being given a sample of her handwriting by the 'fortune teller', who takes it from a 'devil' he has conjured up under the table (in fact Plume). Kite is then visited by Brazen, who gives him a love letter from, as he thinks, Melinda. However, by comparing the handwriting sample, Worthy discovers that the letter is in fact from Melinda's maid Lucy, who hopes to ensnare Brazen as a husband.\nWorthy then goes to visit Melinda but, on going to tell Plume the good news, finds out that Melinda seems to be eloping with Brazen after all. Worthy intercepts Brazen and a disguised woman he takes this to be Melinda, and challenges Brazen to a duel. The duel is prevented when the woman drops her disguise and reveals herself to be Lucy. Sylvia also drops her disguise. Plume agrees to leave the army and marry her, Melinda relents towards Worthy and agrees to marry him, and Plume transfers his twenty recruits to Brazen to compensate him for the loss of a rich marriage with Melinda.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Shrewsbury."}], "question": "At first Captain Plume's Sergeant recruited at what town?", "id": "1b82b15048e60b850bcaa1a8c719cf4008d0fbb8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She inherited money."}], "question": "Why did Worthy now think Melinda was adequate to marry after refusing to a year before?

Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is \"the one who should be fired.\"\nBruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God.

God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.\nAfter taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who confronts Bruce about his selfish use of his powers. He explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them. Bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle \u2014 even though God had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area \u2014 and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer.\nDuring a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion, Susan seduces and kisses him. When Grace arrives and sees this, she storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him. He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself. Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing Evan to have his job back.\nBruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can. As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Grace, wishing for Bruce's success and well-being. As he reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore. A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived \u2014 near miraculously \u2014 by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged. After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live TV. The film ends with the doomsayer Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Television news reporter"}], "question": "What job does Bruce Nolan have?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Evan Baxter"}], "question": "Who is promoted instead of Bruce?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His pager"}], "question": "How did Bruce receive messages from God?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Use the toilet"}], "question": "What does Bruce train his dog to do using God's powers?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She thought he was going to propose"}], "question": "Why does Grace, Bruce's girlfriend, get angry when they are out to dinner?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Saleen S7"}], "question": "What type of car does Bruce change his beat up car into?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He gets hit by a truck"}], "question": "What happens to Bruce to return him to God?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Susan, his co-worker"}], "question": "Who seduces Bruce at his celebration party?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Answers \"yes\" to all of them"}], "question": "How does Bruce handle all the prayers he receives?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Eyewitness News WKBW-TV"}], "question": "Who is Bruce's employer?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "an anchorman"}], "question": "At the beginning of the story, what is Bruce's dream job?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "God"}], "question": "After being fired and facing other setbacks, who does Bruce blame?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An empty warehouse"}], "question": "After receiving a message on his pager, where does Bruce meet God?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A meteor"}], "question": "While using his new powers, what does Bruce cause to fall nearby (without causing harm) at a cook off?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she thought Bruce was going to propose"}], "question": "Why was Grace angry when she heard about the promotion?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A computerized system"}], "question": "What does Bruce create to address and respond to prayer requests?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Buffalo"}], "question": "God tells Bruce he is only receiving prayer requests from what area?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seduces and kisses Bruce"}], "question": "What does Susan do at Bruce's promotion party?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grace"}], "question": "Who does Bruce receive a prayer request from which states that she wishes for Bruce's success and well-being?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "field reporting"}], "question": "After his recovery, what career does Bruce find himself in?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "God"}], "question": "Who does Bruce meet in the warehouse?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To prove that Bruce is doing his job correctly."}], "question": "Why does God give Bruce powers?", "id": "1da161b6007d46d85eda16ae391e1e78218fabd2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A computerized system "}], "question": "What does Bruce create in order to recieve the prayers and respond to them?

He is stolen by the gardener's assistant, however, sold to fund the latter's gambling addiction, and shipped to Seattle. Put in a crate, he is starved and ill-treated. When released, he attacks the \"man in the red sweater\" but is badly beaten and taught to respect the \"law of the club\". Buck is then sold to a pair of French-Canadian dispatchers from the Canadian government, Fran\u0102\u00a7ois and Perrault, who take him with them to the Klondike region of Canada. There, they train him as a sled dog. From his teammates, he quickly learns to survive cold winter nights and the pack society. A rivalry develops between Buck and the vicious, quarrelsome lead dog, Spitz. Buck eventually beats Spitz in a fight \"to the death\". Spitz is killed by the pack after his defeat by Buck, and Buck eventually becomes the leader of the team.\nThe team is then sold to a \"Scottish half-breed\" man working the mail service. The dogs must carry heavy loads to the mining areas, and the journeys they made were tiresome and long. One of the team, a morose husky named Dave, becomes sick and eventually has to be shot to end his misery.\nBuck's next owners are a trio of stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at surviving in the Northern wilderness. They struggle to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes him to be a remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with the butt of his axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs.\nBuck comes to love and grow devoted to Thornton as he nurses him back to health. He saves Thornton when the man falls into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, a bonanza king (someone who hit it rich in a certain area) wagers Thornton on the dog's strength and devotion. Buck wins by breaking a half-ton (1,000-pound (450\u00c2\u00a0kg)) sled free of the frozen ground, pulling it 100 yards (91\u00c2\u00a0m) and winning US$1,600 in gold dust. A king of the Skookum Benches offers a large sum to buy Buck, but Thornton has grown fond of him and declines. While Thornton and his friends continue their search for gold, Buck explores the wilderness and socializes with a timber wolf from a local pack. One night, he returns from a long hunt to find that his beloved master and the others in the camp have been killed by a group of Yeehat natives. Buck eventually kills the natives to avenge Thornton, and he then is attacked by an entire pack of wolves. Buck wins the fight, then finds that the same timber wolf he had socialized with is in the pack he fought. Buck then follows the wolf and its pack into the forest, and answers the call of the wild. At the end of the story, Buck returns each year as the Ghost Dog of the Northland Legend, to mourn at the site of Thornton's death.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Buck"}], "question": "What is Judge Millers dog's name?", "id": "1fa32a0798f79e13ca92ae84eda9ab3eb12c70a4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "sled dog"}], "question": "What type of dog is he trained to be in Canada?

Theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) observes the proceedings and, in a sardonic voiceover, recalls how Eve's star rose as quickly as it did.\nThe film flashes back a year. Margo Channing (Bette Davis) is one of the biggest stars on Broadway, but despite her success she is bemoaning her age, having just turned forty and knowing what that will mean for her career. After a performance one night, Margo's close friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), wife of the play's author Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), meets besotted fan Eve Harrington in the cold alley outside the stage door. Recognizing her from having passed her many times in the alley (as Eve claims to have seen every performance of Margo's current play, Aged in Wood), Karen takes her backstage to meet Margo. Eve tells the group gathered in Margo's dressing room\u2014Karen and Lloyd, Margo's boyfriend Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill), a director who is eight years her junior, and Margo's maid Birdie (Thelma Ritter)\u2014that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to New York after seeing her in a play in San Francisco. She tells a moving story of growing up poor and losing her young husband in the recent war. Moved, Margo quickly befriends Eve, takes her into her home, and hires her as her assistant, leaving Birdie, who instinctively dislikes Eve, feeling put out.\nEve is gradually shown to be working to supplant Margo, scheming to become her understudy behind her back, driving wedges between her and Lloyd and Bill, and conspiring with an unsuspecting Karen to cause Margo to miss a performance. Eve, knowing in advance that she will be the one appearing that night, invites the city's theatre critics to attend that evening's performance, which is a triumph for her. Eve tries to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Following a scathing newspaper column by Addison, Margo and Bill reconcile, dine with the Richardses, and decide to marry. That same night at the restaurant, Eve blackmails Karen into telling Lloyd to give her the part of Cora, by threatening to tell Margo of Karen's role in Margo's missed performance. Before Karen can talk with Lloyd, Margo announces to everyone's surprise that she does not wish to play Cora and would prefer to continue in Aged in Wood. Eve secures the role and attempts to climb higher by using Addison, who is beginning to doubt her. Just before the premiere of her play at the Shubert in New Haven, Eve presents Addison with her next plan: to marry Lloyd, who, she claims, has come to her professing his love and his eagerness to leave his wife for her. Now, Eve exults, Lloyd will write brilliant plays showcasing her. Unseen but mentioned in dialogue, Karen has begun to suspect Eve as a threat to her own marriage to Lloyd, and so she and Addison meet for lunch and help each other put the pieces about Eve together. Addison is infuriated that Eve has attempted to use him and reveals that he knows that her back story is all lies. Her real name is Gertrude Slojinski, she was never married, and she had been paid to leave her hometown over an affair with her boss, a brewer in Wisconsin. Addison blackmails Eve, informing her that she will not be marrying Lloyd or anyone else; in exchange for Addison's silence, she now \"belongs\" to him.\nThe film returns to the opening scene in which Eve, now a shining Broadway star headed for Hollywood, is presented with her award. In her speech, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd and Karen with characteristic effusion, while all four stare back at her coldly. After the awards ceremony, Eve hands her award to Addison, skips a party in her honor, and returns home alone, where she encounters a young fan (Barbara Bates)\u2014a high-school girl\u2014who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. The young girl professes her adoration and begins at once to insinuate herself into Eve's life, offering to pack Eve's trunk for Hollywood and being accepted. \"Phoebe\", as she calls herself, answers the door to find Addison returning with Eve's award. In a revealing moment, the young girl flirts daringly with the older man. Addison hands over the award to Phoebe and leaves without entering. Phoebe then lies to Eve, telling her it was only a cab driver who dropped off the award. While Eve rests in the other room, Phoebe dons Eve's elegant costume robe and poses in front of a multi-paned mirror, holding the award as if it were a crown. The mirrors transform Phoebe into multiple images of herself, and she bows regally, as if accepting the award to thunderous applause, while triumphant music plays.", "qas": [{"answers":

of Dillsborough, in the fictional Rufford County. The two principal subplots centre on the courtship behaviour of two young women.\nThe heroine, Mary Masters, is the daughter of an attorney, and has been raised as a gentlewoman. Her stepmother is from a lower social order; believing it best for Mary, she pressures her strongly to accept a proposal from Lawrence Twentyman, a prosperous young yeoman farmer with aspirations to gentility. While Mary respects Twentyman for his excellent qualities, she feels that she cannot love him as a wife should a husband. She admires Reginald Morton, whose cousin is the squire of Bragton and thus one of the two major landowners of Rufford County. Reginald admires Mary as well; but for most of the novel, each is ignorant of the other's feelings: Mary, as a gentlewoman, cannot take the initiative in such a matter; and Reginald, misinformed that Mary loves another, is unwilling to make an offer and have it rejected.\nThe anti-heroine of the novel is Arabella Trefoil. Her father is cousin to the Duke of Mayfair; her mother was a banker's daughter. Her parents are unofficially separated, and living in straitened circumstances. Arabella and her mother, Lady Augustus Trefoil, have no fixed abode; they wander from place to place, visiting people who cannot refuse them without creating social awkwardness. At Lady Augustus's direction, Arabella has spent many years struggling to secure a rich husband who will give her and her mother high social standing, an assured income, and a house of their own. She has lately become provisionally engaged to John Morton, the squire of Bragton and a rising figure in the Foreign Office. He would be an adequate but not outstanding husband by her standards; and when the opportunity presents itself, she attempts to entrap the wealthy and titled young Lord Rufford, concealing these attempts from Morton so that she can accept his proposal should they fail.\nJohn Morton falls ill and dies. Arabella, who is not altogether wicked, visits him at his deathbed despite the fact that this will assist Lord Rufford in escaping her toils. After Morton's death, she accepts an offer of marriage from Mounser Green, a Foreign Office clerk who is taking Morton's place as ambassador-designate to Patagonia. Like Morton, Green is not a brilliant match for her, but an acceptable one. John Morton's death makes Reginald Morton the squire of Bragton; at this point, when Mary Masters fears that he has moved too far above her in status, he confesses his love to her. A proposal ensues and is eagerly accepted.\nThe American senator of the title is Elias Gotobed, who sits in the US Senate for the fictional state of Mikewa. The guest of John Morton, Senator Gotobed is trying to learn about England and the English. Through his often-tactless remarks in conversation, through his letters to a friend in America, and through a lecture in London titled \"The Irrationality of Englishmen\", he comments on British justice and government, the Church of England, the custom of primogeniture, and other aspects of English life.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Reginald Morton"}], "question": "Who proposes to Mary Masters?", "id": "206ee38a1991579ed174f236490a9064e573a878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she is a gentlewoman and she cannot go against tradition"}], "question": "Why doesn't Mary Masters tell Reginald how she feels?", "id": "206ee38a1991579ed174f236490a9064e573a878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because Lord Rufford is wealthier and has a higher status"}], "question": "Why does Arabella Trefoil want to marry Lord Rufford instead of John Morton?", "id": "206ee38a1991579ed174f236490a9064e573a878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mounser Green"}], "question": "Who does Arabella Trefoil agree to marry after John Morton dies?", "id": "206ee38a1991579ed174f236490a9064e573a878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ambassador Designate to Patgonia"}], "question": "What is mounser Green's official title?

The evidence seems impossible to dispute: many colleagues saw her having a quarrel with the victim, their cars are parked right next to each other, she is seen leaving the crime scene seconds before the body is discovered, the murder weapon (a fire extinguisher) has her fingerprints on it and she has the victim's blood on the back of her overcoat. Following the failure of her appeal, her son Luke ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits. One day, Lara attempts suicide, unwilling to spend the rest of her life in prison. Her husband John Brennan (Russell Crowe), a professor at a community college, becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her out of jail.\nJohn consults Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a former convict who escaped prison seven times. Damon gives John advice, along with a warning that the initial escape will be easy compared to evading the police after that. Following Damon's advice, John begins his preparation. He obtains a handgun and fake IDs, and studies the map of Pittsburgh for escape routes. To get money, he sells their house's furniture and personal belongings. John attempts to break Lara out from the prison in which she is held but abandons the plan when he is almost caught testing a self-made \"bump key\" on an elevator.\nWhen John is told that Lara will be transferred in 72 hours to another prison facility, he is forced to come up with an emergency plan. Unable to get the money from his house in time, he considers robbing a bank, but hesitates at the last minute. Instead, John tails a local drug dealer to a drug lord, then robs him. Following clues left behind at the drug lord's house, the police track down John's car, get to his empty house and conclude that he is planning to break his wife out.\nJohn tears down the big map filled with notes and photos of his escape plan, and scatter the pieces. He leaves Luke at his classmate's birthday party, then plants falsified blood work indicating that Lara is in a state of hyperglycaemia. Lara is transferred to a nearby hospital, where John convinces her to escape with him.\nJohn and Lara leave the hospital, narrowly escaping the police and leave the city center. They then find out that Luke is at the zoo for the birthday party. John drives there to retrieve him, by which point the police have already established roadblocks on all interstate routes. Anticipating that police are looking for \"a couple and a child\", John improvises by picking up an elderly couple. They drive through the checkpoint without incident and proceed to Buffalo, New York, where John drops off the couple. The Brennans cross the border into Canada and head to an airport. Meanwhile, John's parents refuse to cooperate with the police. The police examine the escape plan fragments to figure out his destination, but are misled by the photos and delay the wrong flight.\nA detective returns to the crime scene where Lara's boss was killed. He remembers Lara saying a button popped off as the mugger bumped into her, and deduces that it must have fallen in the storm drain. He searches the storm drain but is unable to find the button. It turns out the button was there, buried under grime, and the detective just missed it. While the police haven't the evidence to exonerate Lara Brennan, the audience does, because a flashback reveals how her boss died at the hands of a mugger, and how Lara came to have the victim's blood on her coat, and her fingerprints on the murder weapon. At the end of the film, the family arrives at a hotel in Caracas, Venezuela. As Lara lies down next to him, Luke kisses his mother and falls asleep. John takes a picture of their sleeping faces as the movie ends.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Life in prison."}], "question": "What is Laura Brennan's sentence for allegedly

prosperous new nation, and are elected King and Queen. The kingdom's villains are imprisoned on the Isle of the Lost, a slum where magic is suspended and surrounded by a barrier. Twenty years later, Prince Ben is to ascend the Auradon throne and informs his parents that his first proclamation is give the Isle of the Lost's children the chance to live in Auradon, away from the influence of their villainous parents. The first four children he has chosen are Carlos, son of Cruella de Vil; Jay, son of Jafar; Evie, daughter of Evil Queen; and Mal, daughter of Maleficent. On the island, Maleficent instructs the four chosen children to use the opportunity and steal the Fairy Godmother's magic wand to release the villains.\nTraveling to Auradon Prep, the four meet Ben and his self-proclaimed girlfriend Audrey, daughter of Princess Aurora. They also meet the Fairy Godmother who is the school's headmistress. Evie uses her mother's pocket-sized magic mirror to locate the wand that's in a nearby museum, and Mal uses her mother's spinning wheel (an artifact in the museum) to put the guard to sleep, but they fail to steal it. Learning the Fairy Godmother will use the wand at Ben's coronation, the four wait it out by attending classes but start to fit in with the students. Jay is recruited into the school's \"tourney\" team (a hockey-like sport), while Carlos surpasses his cynophobia by befriending the school's mutt Dude. Evie, though intelligent, acts vain to impress Chad, son of Cinderella, but ends up doing his homework for him. Dopey's son Doug encourages her to not pander to others and be herself.\nMal becomes popular, using Maleficent's spell book to improve the looks of Jane, daughter of Fairy Godmother, and Lonnie, daughter of Mulan. Learning also Ben's girlfriend will be seated close to the wand during the coronation, Mal bakes a cookie laced with a love potion and gives it to Ben, who falls madly in love with her, much to the shock of his friends. On a date with Ben, Mal becomes conflicted with her inner goodness and desire to please her mother, unsure how to react to Ben's feelings towards her. During the school's family day, the villains' children are ostracized after an encounter with Audrey's grandmother Queen Leah. Though Ben, Lonnie and Doug remain friendly towards them, they are forced to distance themselves from the quartet.\nOn the day of the coronation, Mal gives Ben a brownie containing the love spell's antidote, believing it is unnecessary to keep Ben under the spell, but he reveals he was already freed of the spell since their date when he went swimming in the Enchanted Lake and believing that Mal only did it because she really liked him. During Ben's crowning, a disillusioned Jane grabs the wand from her mother, accidentally destroying the Isle's barrier. Mal takes the wand from Jane, but torn over what to do, is encouraged by Ben to make her own choice rather than follow Maleficent's path. Mal recognizes that she and her friends found happiness in Auradon, and they decide to be good.\nMaleficent crashes the ceremony, freezing everyone in time except herself and the four children. When they defy her, Maleficent transforms into a dragon. Together with Mal use a counter spell turning Maleficent into a tiny lizard based on the amount of love in her heart. Mal returns the Fairy Godmother her wand and tells her not to be hard on Jane. The Fairy Godmother then unfreezes everyone. While the villains watch the celebration from afar, Auradon Prep's students party through the night, with Mal and her friends finding happiness.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Carlos, Jay, Evie, Mal"}], "question": "Which four children are released from the Isle of the Lost?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Steal the Fairy Godmother's wand"}], "question": "What is the children's secret plan?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ben"}], "question": "Who does Mal give a cookie laced with a love potion to?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tourney team"}], "question": "What team does Jay join at school?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jane and Lonnie"}], "question": "Who does Mal improve the looks of with her mother's spell book?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jane"}], "question": "Who takes the wand from the Fairy Godmother at the coronation?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The barrier around the isle is broken"}], "question": "What happens when Jane takes her mother's wand?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A dragon"}], "question": "What does Malificent turn into when the kids defy her?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A tiny lizard"}], "question": "What do the kids turn the dragon Malificent into?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mal"}], "question": "Who returns the fairy Godmother's wand?", "id": "214cb5277750c1ccddec0b10fa545c3c78c45f64"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The fairy godmother's wand.

a New Orleans hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches; she asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.\nFrom the reading, it is revealed that on the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy was born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The baby's mother died after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. \"Tizzy\" Weathers, workers at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.\nBenjamin learns to walk in 1925; he declares it a miracle, after which he uses crutches in place of a wheelchair. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. He and Daisy become good friends. Later, he accepts work on a tugboat captained by Mike Clark. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In Autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew; Daisy later is accepted into a dance company in New York City under choreographer George Balanchine.\nIn 1941, Benjamin is in Murmansk, where he begins having an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister. That December, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, thrusting the United States into World War II. Mike volunteers the boat for the U.S. Navy; the crew is assigned to salvage duties. During a patrol, the tugboat finds a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of many American troops. A German submarine surfaces; Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards it while a German gunner fires on the tugboat, killing most of the crew, including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine, causing it to explode, sinking both vessels. Benjamin and another crewman are rescued by U.S. Navy ships the next day.\nIn May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans and reunites with Queenie. A few weeks later, he reunites with Daisy; they go out for dinner. Upon failing to seduce him afterward, she departs. Benjamin later reunites with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals he is Benjamin's father and wills Benjamin his button company and his estate.\nIn 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing that she has fallen in love with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in Paris. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his youthful appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.\nIn spring 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and go sailing together. They return to learn that Queenie has died, then move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, tells Benjamin that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a girl, Caroline, in the spring of 1968. Believing he can not be a proper father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, Benjamin departs after selling his belongings, leaving a bank account book holding the proceeds behind for Daisy and Caroline; he travels alone during the 1970s.\nBenjamin returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him, as a family friend, to her husband and daughter. Daisy admits that he was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. She later visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they again share their passion for each other, then part once more.\nIn 1990, widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who have found Benjamin\u7ab6\u99acow physically a pre-teen. When she arrives, they explain that he was living in a condemned building and was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and that they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers also say he is displaying early signs of dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life. In the spring of 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 84 years of age. Having finally revealed the story of Caroline's father to her, Daisy dies as Hurricane Katrina approaches.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He gets younger in appeearance"}], "question": "What happens as Benjamin Button ages chronologically?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is his daughter"}], "question": "What is Caroline's relationship to Bejamin?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hurricane Katrina"}], "question": "What disater hits New Orleans right before Daisy dies?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dancing"}], "question": "What professiion did Daisy partake in before having a car accident?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "World War !!"}], "question": "In what war does Benjamin Button serve?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elizabeth Abbot"}], "question": "With whom does Benjamin have an affair with?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A nursing home"}], "question": "Where does Benjamin Button eventually die?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An infant's"}], "question": "What life stage is Benjamin Button at when he passes away?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "84"}], "question": "How old is Benjamin when he dies?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Button business"}], "question": "What type of family business does Benjamin eventually inherit?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Daisy Fuller"}], "question": "Which character is on their deathbed at the beginning of the story?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Caroline"}], "question": "What is Daisy Fuller's daughters name?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Queenie Weathers"}], "question": "What woman decides to care for the baby left at the nursing home?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Benjamin Button"}], "question": "What is the main characters name?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Daisy"}], "question": "Who does Benjamin meet on Thanksgiving?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elizabeth Abbot"}], "question": "Who does Benjamin have an affair with?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "New Orleans"}], "question": "In what city does Benjamin reunite with Queenie?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Go sailing"}], "question": "What do Benjamin and Daisy do soon after falling in love?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Daisy"}], "question": "Whose arms does Benjamin die in?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Benjamin"}], "question": "Who was Carolines father?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hurricane Katrina"}], "question": "What catastrophic event is occurring that makes Daisy Fuller ask her daughter to read a story?", "id": "21813f2122fca16d05e89d44f4521f7da8a8f3b7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Benjamin was not able to walk.

Wells expresses confidence that methods of aerial dominance, combined with photography, have permitted the Allies to develop tactics that are sure ultimately to defeat Germany. Wells praises British soldiers but criticises the officer corps for its mental rigidity. He emphasises that new technologies have transformed the art of war in ways that military professionals are all too slow to grasp. In particular, fighting in disciplined formations and cavalry are no longer of any military importance, while \"[a]rtillery is now the most essential instrument of the war.\" Wells describes a tour of a munitions factory given by Andr\u0102\u0160 Citro\u0102\u0164n. He devotes a chapter to tanks as \"a beginning in a new phase of warfare\" noting that in 1903 he had described a tank in a short story (\"The Land Ironclads\").\nWar and the Future's final part is entitled \"How People Think about the War\" and addresses a miscellany of subjects: (1) the failure of contemporaries to grasp the nature and causes of the war; (2) the psychology of what he calls \"the Yielding Pacifist\" (willing to accept any sort of peace), whose origins he finds in \"the Resentful Employ\u0102\u0160,\" and of \"the Conscientious Objector,\" pages he later deeply regretted; (3) the effect of the war on religious thought; (4) French and Italian doubts about the British; (5) the effect of the war on future labour relations; (6) the prospects for ending the war. On the last subject, Wells saw a possibility of victory in 1917, but allowed that \"the war, universally detested, may go on into 1918 or 1919.\" Wells said that \"America should ultimately undertake the responsibility of a world peace settlement.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He says it is the King of Italy.

They use underhanded and dubious tactics to make sales. Many of the leads rationed out by the office manager lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land.\nBlake (Baldwin) is sent by Mitch and Murray, the owners of Premier Properties, to motivate the salesmen. Blake unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse on the men and announces that only the top two sellers will be allowed access to the more promising Glengarry leads and the rest of them will be fired.\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene (Lemmon), a once-successful salesman now in a long-running slump and with a chronically ill daughter in the hospital with an unknown medical condition, knows that he will lose his job soon if he cannot generate sales. He tries to convince office manager John Williamson (Spacey) to give him some of the Glengarry leads, but Williamson refuses. Levene tries first to charm Williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. Levene cannot come up with the cash and leaves without any good leads.\nMeanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) complain about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that they strike back at the two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accessory before the fact simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.\nAt a nearby bar, Ricky Roma (Pacino), the office's top \"closer,\" delivers a long, disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk (Pryce). Roma does not broach the subject of a Glengarry Farms real estate deal until he has completely won Lingk over with his speech. Framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays upon Lingk's feelings of insecurity.\nThe film then skips to the next day when the salesmen come into the office to find that there has been a burglary and the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private. After his interrogation, Moss leaves in disgust, only after having one last shouting match with Roma. During the cycle of interrogations, Lingk arrives to tell Roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal. Scrambling to salvage the deal, Roma tries to deceive Lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed, and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider.\nLevene abets Roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport. Williamson, unaware of Roma and Levene's stalling tactic, lies to Lingk, claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank. Upset, Lingk rushes out of the office, and Roma berates Williamson for what he has done. Roma then enters Williamson's office to take his turn being interrogated by the police.\nLevene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal to get back at Williamson, Levene accidentally reveals that he knows Williamson lied to Roma minutes earlier about depositing Lingk's check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something only a man who broke into the office would know. Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, \"Because I don't like you.\"\nLevene makes a last-ditch attempt at gaining sympathy from Williamson by mentioning his daughter's health, but Williamson cruelly rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective about Levene's part in the burglary. Roma walks out of the room as Williamson enters. Unaware of Levene's guilt, Roma talks to Levene about forming a business partnership before the detective starts calling for Levene. Levene walks, defeated, into Williamson's office. Roma then leaves the office to go out for lunch, while Aaronow returns back to his desk to make his sales calls as usual.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "two days"}], "question": "Over what period of time does the story take place?", "id": "21bac5f922f18e036b67f8ac938fccc238adc55c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "real estate salesmen"}], "question": "What is the occupation of the four main characters?", "id": "21bac5f922f18e036b67f8ac938fccc238adc55c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They will be fired"}], "question": "Blake tells the salesmen that the top two will get the Glengarry leads.

The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red.\nTo restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. But one night Moore is violently murdered in the office and Capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death.\nMoore would gather his patients every Monday for a discussion of their problems. Police detective Lt. Hector Martinez (Blades) considers them, and possibly Capa, suspects in the murder. Capa continues to live in Moore's house and begins an affair with Rose (March), a mysterious girl who comes and goes. He takes over Moore's therapy group and learns of their pasts and obsessions:\nClark (Brad Dourif) suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things. He also has a violent temper, and months earlier beat up his wife.\nSondra (Lesley Ann Warren) is a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac. She stabbed her father with a knife and fork and her husband died of unnatural causes.\nBuck (Lance Henriksen) is a suicidal ex-cop. The murder of his wife and daughter remains unsolved.\nCasey (Kevin J. O'Connor), the arrogant son of a wealthy man, paints sado-masochist works of art. He once burned down his father's house.\nRichie is a transgender 16-year-old who wishes to transition to female. Richie also has social anxiety disorder, a stutter and a history of drug use.\nOne of these patients is violently murdered. Capa also becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose.\nThis leads to a twist ending: \"Richie\" is really Rose, and the murders have been committed by her deranged brother Dale (Andrew Lowery). They once had an actual brother named Richie who was molested by a child psychiatrist named Niedelmeyer. Richie committed suicide and, unable to cope with the loss, Dale forced Rose to play the part of their brother. Dale \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who was also one of Niedelmeyer's victims \u00e2\u0080\u0094 began abusing Rose until she actually became \"Richie\". When \"Richie\" was arrested for drug possession, \"he\" was forced into therapy. Rose soon started to re-emerge and, under another personality, \"Bonnie\", started relationships with other members of the group. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to \"Richie\".\nCapa confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Capa is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one at the beginning, resulting in Capa's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He needed to restart his life.

Believing she is depressed, Hazel's mother Frannie (Laura Dern) urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends who are going through the same thing.\nOne week, Hazel meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer years earlier but has since been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house and she accepts, where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.\nWeeks later, Augustus tells Hazel that he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek), and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. Hazel then writes to him to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending and Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Overwhelmed and excited, Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie rejects it because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use her \"cancer wish\" since children and young adults with life-threatening illnesses receive one arranged experience of their choice, but Hazel explains that she already used hers to visit Disney World when she was younger. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and soon begin to fall in love. Augustus also surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam after using his wish on her. However, days before the trip, Hazel suffers from pleural effusion and is sent to an intensive care unit (ICU). Although initially concerned, her doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.\nHazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid for by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten's house, but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic; Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner on his behalf without him knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. On their way back to the hotel, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day while out in the city, Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has relapsed, has spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.\nAfter their return to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens each week. Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station. He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he \"gave me a forever within the numbered days.\"\nAugustus dies eight days later. At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna's mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel. Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says \"Okay.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Indianapolis"}], "question": "Where

The story concerns a two-year-old girl who drifts in a boat onto a beach in Glamorganshire in the calm before a storm. The little girl calls herself Bardie. Llewellyn is tempted to keep the girl, but decides to give her up and keeps the boat for himself. He quarters the pretty child in a simple, but well-to-do, household in his neighbourhood. As she grows up he dotes upon her so far as he can. He watches anxiously over her fortunes, partly or principally because he thinks his own may be bound up with them. It is clear from the refinement of the girl's manners, and from the fineness of her clothes she was washed ashore in, that she is no common child.\nDavy joins the crew of a ketch trading between Barnstaple and Porthcawl. Whilst in Devon, he encounters several characters who hold the key to solving the mystery of the maid of Sker. These include Sir Philip Bampfylde who spends most of his time looking for his two grandchildren who have mysteriously disappeared; Parson Chowne, a parson of demoniac wickedness and craft who works his will for many years in the north of Devon, defying God, man, and the law; and Captain Drake Bamfylde who is under suspicion of having made away with the children of his elder brother, and heirs to the family property. Old Davy gradually unravels the mystery and sets matters right, although many distractions delay him including an extended period at sea in which Blackmore gives a graphic account of the Battle of the Nile.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The end of the 18th Century."}], "question": "When does The Maid of the Sker take place?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Davy Llewellyn, a fisherman."}], "question": "Who tells the story?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bardie."}], "question": "What does the 2-year-old girl call herself?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sir Phillip Bampfylde"}], "question": "Whose grandchildren have mysteriously disappeared?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In hopes that he can see some of the family fortune."}], "question": "Why does Davy dote Bardie so strongly?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Fine clothes and refined manners."}], "question": "What gives Bardie away that she is not a commoner?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He joins Ketch trading."}], "question": "What kind of crew does Davy join?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Parson Chowne."}], "question": "Who does he meet who is a demon and wicked?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Drake Bampfylde."}], "question": "Who is suspected of kidnapping Phillip Bampfylde's grandchildren?", "id": "24c8ed4f493ab62acff4da9bad5c6a1c07e4770d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His two grandchildren "}], "question": "Who is Sir Philip Bampfylde searching for?

Gunnery Sergeant, acting as a selection cadre member for Delta Force. While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor.\nScott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone.\nCalls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation.\nWhen the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in Dubai.\nScott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.\nAs the team prepares an assault in Dubai, a news broadcast reports that Laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The rescue operation is called off. Scott returns home, but Curtis tracks him down and persuades him that Laura is alive and shows Scott an earring that was caught in his mat from the beach house identical to those Laura is wearing in a news photograph.\nWhen they return to the beach house, Curtis is killed by a sniper. Scott evades the sniper and finds Laura's unique sign in a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she is not dead. He takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device.\nHe tries to contact Laura's mother but he is intercepted by a female Secret Service agent assigned to guard the First Family. When he shows the agent the earring, the agent explains that for years the President has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled Laura's Secret Service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip.\nScott enlists Sergeant Black to help him rescue the girl from Dubai and turns to Avi, a former Israeli operative. Avi agrees to get him into Dubai and smuggle Laura out concealed in a cargo container, obtaining weapons for him and support from a man known as Jones.\nJones is killed during the rescue and Scott flees with Laura to a safe house, where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders. Correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, Laura says that King Leonidas of Sparta would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him.\nWhen he takes Laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, Scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. He rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. Scott is shot and Laura is captured. Her captor reveals herself as Sgt. Black, who shows her the earring and photos from the Secret Service agent, convincing Laura to stop struggling. A Swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize Laura. Black is shot by Stoddard, and a hysterical Laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. Just as the jet takes off, Stoddard's throat is slit by Scott. An injured Black then asks Scott if Laura is now safe, which Scott confirms.\nLater, on a London city street, a stubbled Scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding Laura's return on a television in a shop window. The government spins the story of Laura's kidnapping as an opportunity for the President to take action to end the trafficking of American girls as sex slaves. A British man watching the news broadcast with Scott then says, \"Time to go home,\" and walks away. Scott watches him leave and says, \"Lucky man.\" Scott is then seen walking off into Piccadilly Circus.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Master Gunnery Sergeant "}], "question":

The man of wealth and pride\nTakes up a space that many poor supplied;\nSpace for his lake, his park's extended bounds,\nSpace for his horses, equipage, and hounds:\nThe robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth\nHas robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth (lines 275\u2013300)\nThe poem later condemns the luxury and corruption of the city, and describes the fate of a country girl who moved there:\nWhere the poor houseless shivering female lies.\nShe once, perhaps, in village plenty blessed,\nHas wept at tales of innocence distressed;\nHer modest looks the cottage might adorn,\nSweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:\nNow lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,\nNear her betrayer's door she lays her head,\nAnd, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,\nWith heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,\nWhen idly first, ambitious of the town,\nShe left her wheel and robes of country brown. (Lines 326\u201336)\nGoldsmith then states that the residents of Auburn have not moved to the city, but have emigrated overseas. He describes these foreign lands as follows:\nFar different there from all that charmed before\nThe various terrors of that horrid shore;\nThose blazing suns that dart a downward ray,\nAnd fiercely shed intolerable day (lines 345\u20138)\nThe poem mentions \"wild Altama\", a river in Georgia, an American colony founded by James Oglethorpe to receive paupers and criminals from Britain. As the poem nears its end, Goldsmith gives a warning, before reporting that even Poetry herself has fled abroad:\nEven now the devastation is begun,\nAnd half the business of destruction done;\nEven now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,\nI see the rural virtues leave the land.\nDown where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail (lines 395\u20139)\nThe poem ends with the hope that Poetry can help those who have been exiled:\nStill let thy voice, prevailing over time,\nRedress the rigours of the inclement clime;\nAid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain,\nTeach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;\nTeach him, that states of native strength possest,\nTho' very poor, may still be very blest;\nThat trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,\nAs ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away;\nWhile self-dependent power can time defy,\nAs rocks resist the billows and the sky.

just finished playing cards. A footman comes and tells Mirabell that Waitwell (Mirabell's male servant) and Foible (Lady Wishfort's female servant) were married that morning. Mirabell tells Fainall about his love of Millamant and is encouraged to marry her. Witwoud and Petulant appear and Mirabell is informed that should Lady Wishfort marry, he will lose \u00a36000 of Millamant's inheritance.He will only get this money if he can make Lady Wishfort consent to his and Millamant's marriage.\nAct 2 is set in St. James\u2019 Park. Mrs. Fainall and Mrs. Marwood are discussing their hatred of men. Fainall appears and accuses Mrs. Marwood (with whom he is having an affair) of loving Mirabell (which she does). Meanwhile, Mrs. Fainall (Mirabell's former lover) tells Mirabell that she hates her husband, and they begin to plot to deceive Lady Wishfort into giving her consent to the marriage. Millamant appears in the park and, angry about the previous night (when Mirabell was confronted by Lady Wishfort), she tells Mirabell of her displeasure in his plan, which she only has a vague idea about. After she leaves, the newly wed servants appear and Mirabell reminds them of their roles in the plan.\nActs 3, 4 and 5 are all set in the home of Lady Wishfort. We are introduced to Lady Wishfort who is encouraged by Foible to marry the supposed Sir Rowland \u2013 Mirabell's supposed uncle \u2013 so that Mirabell will lose his inheritance. Sir Rowland is, however, Waitwell in disguise, and the plan is to entangle Lady Wishfort in a marriage which cannot go ahead, because it would be bigamy, not to mention a social disgrace (Waitwell is only a serving man, Lady Wishfort an aristocrat). Mirabell will offer to help her out of the embarrassing situation if she consents to his marriage. Later, Mrs. Fainall discusses this plan with Foible, but this is overheard by Mrs. Marwood. She later tells the plan to Fainall, who decides that he will take his wife's money and go away with Mrs. Marwood.\nMirabell and Millamant, equally strong-willed, discuss in detail the conditions under which they would accept each other in marriage (otherwise known as the \"proviso scene\"), showing the depth of their feeling for each other. Mirabell finally proposes to Millamant and, with Mrs. Fainall's encouragement (almost consent, as Millamant knows of their previous relations), Millamant accepts. Mirabell leaves as Lady Wishfort arrives, and she lets it be known that she wants Millamant to marry her nephew, Sir Wilfull Witwoud, who has just arrived from the countryside. Lady Wishfort later gets a letter telling her about the Sir Rowland plot. Sir Rowland takes the letter and accuses Mirabell of trying to sabotage their wedding. Lady Wishfort agrees to let Sir Rowland bring a marriage contract that night.\nBy Act 5, Lady Wishfort has found out the plot, and Fainall has had Waitwell arrested. Mrs. Fainall tells Foible that her previous affair with Mirabell is now public knowledge. Lady Wishfort appears with Mrs. Marwood, whom she thanks for unveiling the plot. Fainall then appears and uses the information of Mrs. Fainall's previous affair with Mirabell and Millamant's contract to marry him to blackmail Lady Wishfort, telling that she should never marry and that she is to transfer her fortune to him. Lady Wishfort offers Mirabell her consent to the marriage if he can save her fortune and honour. Mirabell calls on Waitwell who brings a contract from the time before the marriage of the Fainalls in which Mrs. Fainall gives all her property to Mirabell. This neutralises the blackmail attempts, after which Mirabell restores Mrs. Fainall's property to her possession and then is free to marry Millamant with the full \u00a36000 inheritance.", "qas":

is granted one and successfully graduates. Spurning an offer from his father to come work for the family business, he determines to make something of himself first, and repairs to Chicago. However, nothing comes of his many attempts to find work, and he despairs. Friendship with a pickpocket known as \"The Lizard\" cheers him up and he reapplies himself, finally finding work in a department store. He also makes the acquaintance of a young lady of quality, one Elizabeth Compton. Torrance gains (and loses) a number of jobs in rapid succession, including ladies' hosiery clerk, waiter, boxer, and milkman, chancing to meet Elizabeth and her friend Harriet Holden in most of these occupations. During his stint as a waiter, he also wins the friendship of a prostitute with a heart of gold named Edith (Little Eva).\nElizabeth's father runs a factory and is worried that he is losing money. He advertises for an \"efficiency expert\" to come help him turn things around. Edith sees the ad and encourages Torrance to apply, writing him fraudulent letters of recommendation to assist him. Torrance does indeed get the job, where he immediately begins to improve things while simultaneously beginning to suspect that someone at the factory is stealing. Elizabeth's fianc\u00e9 Harold Bince, the factory's assistant manager\u00a0\u2013 who is himself the embezzler in question, due to large gambling debts\u00a0\u2013 tries to get Torrance fired, an effort in which Elizabeth herself eagerly assists.\nTorrance figures out the truth and has Mr. Compton engage an outside firm of accountants to prove his case, not wanting to deliver the bad news himself. In desperation, Bince tries to get rid of Torrance, leading up to a violent climax in which Elizabeth's father is murdered and Torrance is framed. The Lizard and Little Eva work to get him off, an effort that finally succeeds when The Lizard takes the stand and proves Torrance could not have committed the murder. Bince, who has persuaded Elizabeth to marry him, is exposed and commits suicide. A sadder and wiser Elizabeth asks Torrance to take over as manager of the factory.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Football"}], "question": "What sport does Jimmy Torrance play?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A pickpocket whom Jimmy became friends with."}], "question": "Who was \"The Lizard\"?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a department store."}], "question": "Where did Jimmy finally find work?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "One with a heart of gold."}], "question": "What kind of prostitute was Edith?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A factory."}], "question": "What does Elizabeth's father manage?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An \"efficiency expert\""}], "question": "Elizabeth's father was trying to hire a what?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Someone was stealing from it."}], "question": "What did Torrance suspect was happening in the factory?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had gambling debts to pay."}], "question": "Why did Harold embezzle from the factory?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He committed suicide."}], "question": "What did Bince end up doing after being exposed of his crimes?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jimmy Torrance."}], "question": "Who became the new manager of the factory?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Chicago"}], "question": "Where does Jimmy attempt to find work first?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A pickpocket "}], "question": "Who is The Lizard?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Waiter"}], "question": "What occupation does Jimmy meet Edith?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Efficiency Expert"}], "question": "What advertisment does Elizabeth's father put out?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Writing fraudulent letters of reccomendation"}], "question": "How does Edith help Torrance apply ?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Someone is stealing"}], "question": "What does Torrance suspect in the factory?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bince"}], "question": "Who is the embezzler?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Torrance"}], "question": "Who is framed for Elizabeth's fathers murder?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Commits suicide"}], "question": "What does Bince do upon his exposure?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Torrance"}], "question": "Who is asked to take over as manager?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The family business."}], "question": "Where did Torrance's father offer him a job?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He wanted to make something of himself first."}], "question": "Why didn't Torrance want to accept his father's job offer?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Little Eva."}], "question": "Who encouraged Torrance to apply for the job at Elizabeth's father's company?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was worried he was losing money."}], "question": "Why did Elizabeth's father hire an efficiency expert for his company?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elizabeth's fiance."}], "question": "Who tried to get Torrance fired?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was murdered."}], "question": "What happened to Elizabeth's father?", "id": "2a798779ffab17c0002f1b127c729cb0387132be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bince.

Their mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, expects \"fine company\" for tea so she fetches the children indoors to wash and dress them before her friends arrive. Tom is \"very naughty\" and scratches his mother while she grooms him. Tabitha dresses Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers, and Tom in \"all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes\" taken from a chest of drawers. Tom is fat and bursts several buttons, but his mother sews them back on again.\nTabitha turns her kittens into the garden to keep them out of the way while she makes hot buttered toast for the party. She tells them to keep their frocks clean and keep away from the pigsty, the dirty ash pit, Sally Henny Penny, and the Puddle-Ducks, and then returns to her work. Moppet and Mittens soon have their pinafores smeared with grass stains. They climb upon the garden wall and lose some of their clothing in the ascent. Tom has a more difficult time gaining the top of the wall \"breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left\". He is disheveled when he reaches the top of the wall, and loses his hat, but his sisters try to pull him together. The rest of his buttons burst.\nThree Puddle-ducks come marching along the road \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \"pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!\" Jemima Puddle-duck and Rebeccah put on some of the dropped clothing. The kittens lose the rest of their clothing descending the wall. Moppet invites Mr. Drake Puddle-duck to help dress Tom. He picks up various articles of Tom's clothing and \"he put[s] them on himself!\" The three ducks set off up the road just as Tabitha approaches and discovers her three children with no clothes on. She pulls them off the wall, \"smacks\" them, and takes them back to the house. \"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted!\" she says.\nTabitha sends her kittens upstairs, and tells her guests the kittens are in bed with the measles. However, \"the dignity and repose of the tea party\" is disturbed by the \"very extraordinary noises overhead\" as the playful kittens romp in a bedroom. An illustration depicts the bedroom in complete disorder and Tom in his mother's bonnet. The next illustration shows Tabitha entering the room. The author interrupts to promise the reader she will make a larger book about Tom some day. In the last pages, the Puddle-ducks have lost the kittens' clothing in a pond, and they have been looking for them ever since.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Three"}], "question":

sting operation in a nightclub to arrest a pimp named Neptune, Miami-Dade Police detectives James \"Sonny\" Crockett and Ricardo \"Rico\" Tubbs receive a frantic phone call from their former informant Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes). Stevens reveals that he's leaving town, and, believing his wife Leonetta to be in immediate danger, asks Rico to check on her. Crockett learns that Stevens was working as an informant for the FBI but has been compromised. Crockett and Tubbs quickly contact FBI Special Agent in Charge John Fujima (Ciar\u0102\u0104n Hinds) and warn him about Stevens' safety. Tracking down Stevens through a vehicle transponder and aerial surveillance, Crockett and Tubbs stop him along I-95. Stevens reveals that a Colombian cartel had become aware that Russian undercovers (now dead) were working with the FBI, and had threatened to murder Leonetta via a C-4 necklace bomb if he didn't confess. Rico, learning of Leonetta's death by telephone call, tells Alonzo that he doesn't have to go home. Hearing this, the grief-stricken Stevens commits suicide by walking in front of an oncoming semi truck.\nEn route to the murder scene, Sonny and Rico receive a call from Lt. Castillo (Barry Shabaka Henley) and are instructed to stay away. He tells them to meet him downtown, where they are introduced in person to John Fujima, head of the Florida Joint Inter-Agency Task Force between the FBI, the DEA, and ICE. Crockett and Tubbs berate Fujima for the errors committed and inquire as to why the MPD wasn't involved. Fujima reveals that the Colombian group is highly sophisticated and run by Jos\u0102\u0160 Yero (John Ortiz), initially thought to be the cartel's leader. Fujima enlists Crockett and Tubbs, making them Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force deputies, to help, and they continue the investigation by looking into go-fast boats coming from the Caribbean, delivering loads of narcotics from the Colombians. They then use their Miami informant contacts to set up a meet and greet with the cartel.\nPosing as drug smugglers, Sonny and Rico offer their services to Yero, the cartel's security and intelligence man. After a high tension meeting they pass screening and are introduced to Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), South Florida's drug trafficking kingpin. In the course of their investigation, Crockett and Tubbs learn that the cartel is using the Aryan Brotherhood to distribute drugs, and is supplying them with state-of-the-art weaponry (which they had used to kill the Russian undercovers). Crockett and Montoya's financial adviser and lover Isabella (Gong Li) begin a secret romance and Tubbs begins to fear for the team's safety. Those fears are soon realized as Trudy (Naomie Harris), the unit's intelligence agent and Rico's girlfriend, is kidnapped by the Aryan Brotherhood by Yero's order, who never trusted Crockett and Tubbs. The Aryan Brotherhood demand for Crockett and Tubbs to deliver the cartel's load directly to them. With Lt. Castillo's help, the unit triangulates Trudy's location to a mobile home in a trailer park and perform a rescue, but she is critically injured when Tubbs fails to evacuate her before a bomb is remotely detonated by Yero. Soon afterwards, Yero reveals Isabella's betrayal to Montoya and captures her. In the showdown, Crockett and Tubbs face off against Yero, his men, and the Aryan Brotherhood at the port of Miami.\nDuring the firefight, Crockett begins to call in backup. When Isabella sees his police shield and radio, she realizes that he's undercover. Betrayed, she demands that Crockett tell her who he really is. After the gunfight, Crockett takes her to a police safe house and tells her she will have to leave the country and return to her home in Cuba.

Los Angeles. Posing as an addict during his investigation, he is approached by Boyd Aviation executive vice president Alan Stanwyk (Matheson) who mistakenly assumes Fletch is a junkie. Stanwyk claims to have bone cancer, with only months left to live, and wishes to avoid the pain and suffering. Stanwyk offers $50,000 for Fletch to come to his mansion in a few days time, kill him, and then escape to Rio de Janeiro, staging the murder to look like a burglary.\nFletch, while not completely convinced on the truth of Stanwyk's story, reluctantly agrees to the plan. Along with his colleague Larry (Davis), he begins investigating Stanwyk instead of completing his drug trafficking expos\u0102\u0160, much to the disapproval of his overbearing editor Frank Walker (Libertini). Disguised as a doctor, Fletch accesses Stanwyk's file at the hospital and learns Stanwyk lied about having cancer.\nFletch visits Stanwyk's wife Gail (Wheeler-Nicholson) at her tennis club. Pretending to be a tennis instructor and friend of Alan's, he flirts with her during an impromptu tennis lesson. Looking into Stanwyk's finances, Fletch finds that Gail recently converted $3 million of her personal stock in Boyd Aviation into cash for her husband, to buy a ranch in Provo, Utah. Fletch breaks into the realtor's office and discovers the deed lists the sale price as only $3,000.\nMeanwhile, LAPD Chief Jerry Karlin (Baker) learns of Fletch's drug article. He warns Fletch that the article will jeopardize his undercover operation on the beach. Karlin threatens to kill Fletch unless he agrees to drop the investigation. At the tennis club, Fletch overhears an arrogant club member, Mr. Underhill, insulting a waiter and decides to use Underhill's tab to treat Gail to an expensive lunch in her private cabana. Fletch reveals Alan's murder scheme to her and tells her the true price of the ranch.\nFletch watches Stanwyk making a suspicious briefcase exchange with Chief Karlin, but is unable to determine the nature of their relationship. He returns home to find LAPD officers lying in wait at his apartment. He flees, but is pursued in a harrowing car chase. Forced to go into hiding, Fletch returns to Provo. Posing as an insurance investigator, he interviews Stanwyk's parents. Fletch discovers Stanwyk has been secretly married to another woman for eight years; his bigamous marriage to Gail allowed him access to her personal wealth.\nFletch arrives at Stanwyk's mansion on the night of the planned murder, but finds Stanwyk prepared to kill him instead. Fletch reveals his discovery of Stanwyk's real plan: to fake his own death by killing Fletch and burning his body beyond recognition, then escape to Brazil with his first wife and Gail's $3 million. Stanwyk was also using his private jet to smuggle cocaine from South America to supply Chief Karlin, who blackmailed ex-convicts to peddle it on the beaches. Karlin arrives unexpectedly; learning of Stanwyk's intention to flee with $800,000 of the Chief's drug money, he kills Stanwyk. Karlin and Fletch fight over the gun until Gail strikes Karlin from behind, rendering him unconscious.\nKarlin is indicted with Fletch's testimony.

buttercups at the edge of a pond. His larder and back passage are \"slippy-sloppy\" with water, but he likes getting his feet wet; no one ever scolds and he never catches cold. One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five minnows, he will invite his friends to dinner. He puts on a Macintosh and shiny Galoshes, takes his rod and basket, and sets off with \"enormous hops\" to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows.\nOnce there, he sits cross-legged on his lily-pad and arranges his tackle. He has \"the dearest little red float\". His rod is a stalk of grass and his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line into the water and immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.\nJeremy sucks his sore fingers, but a trout rises from the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, \"OW-OW-OW!!!\"). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the Macintosh tasteless and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his goloshes. Jeremy bounces \"up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle\", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again.\nIn the last few pages, Jeremy has put sticking plaster on his fingers and welcomes his friends, Sir Isaac Newton, a newt, and Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise, a tortoise who eats salad. Isaac wears a black and gold waistcoat and Ptolemy brings a salad in a string bag. Jeremy has prepared roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce.

The main character is based on David Ritchie, whom Scott met in the autumn of 1797. In the tale, the dwarf is Sir Edward Mauley, a hermit regarded by the locals as being in league with the Devil, who becomes embroiled in a complex tale of love, revenge, betrayal, Jacobite schemes and a threatened forced marriage. Scott began the novel well, \"but tired of the ground I had trode so often before... I quarrelled with my story, & bungled up a conclusion.\"\nCritics and public found it poor in comparison with its popular companion Old Mortality. One of the harshest reviews was in the Quarterly Review, written anonymously by Scott himself.\nThe introduction to The Black Dwarf attributes the work to Jedediah Cleishbotham, whom Scott had invented as a fictional editor of the Landlord series. It is here that we have the most complete view of this character.As Hobbie Elliot was returning over a wild moor from a day's sport, thinking of the legends he had heard of its supernatural occupants after nightfall, he was overtaken by Patrick Earnscliff, whose father had been killed in a quarrel with the laird of Ellislaw, Richard Vere. The moon suddenly revealed the figure of a human dwarf, who, on being spoken to, refused their offers of assistance, and bid them begone. Having invited Earnscliff to sup with his womenfolks, and pass the night at his farm, Hobbie accompanied him next morning to confront the strange being by daylight; and having assisted him in collecting stones for constructing a hut, they supplied him with food and other necessaries. In a short time he had completed his dwelling, and became known to the neighbours, for whose ailments he prescribed, as Elshender the Recluse.\nBeing visited by Isabel Vere and two of her friends, he told their fortunes, and he gave her a rose, with strict injunctions to bring it to him in her hour of adversity. As they rode homewards, their conversation implied that she loved young Patrick Earnscliff, but that Mr Vere intended her to marry Sir Frederick Langley. Another of the dwarf's visitors was Willie Graeme of Westburnflat, on his way to avenge an affront he had received from Hobbie Elliot, whose dog the next day killed one of the dwarf's goats, for which he warned him that retribution was at hand.\nShortly afterwards, Willie Graeme brought word that he and his companions had fired Hobbie's farm, and carried off his sweetheart, Grace Armstrong, and some cattle. On hearing this Elshie despatched him with an order for some money, and insisted that Grace should be given up uninjured. Having dispersed his neighbours in search of her, Hobbie Elliot went to consult Elshie, who handed him a bag of gold, which he declined, and intimated that he must seek her whom he had lost \"in the west.\" Earnscliff and his party had tracked the cattle as far as the English border, but on finding a large Jacobite force assembling there they returned, and it was decided to attack Westburnflat's stronghold. On approaching it, a female hand, which her lover swore was Grace's, waved a signal to them from a turret, and as they were preparing a bonfire to force the door, Graeme agreed to release his prisoner, who proved to be Isabel Vere. On reaching home, however, Elliot found that Grace had been brought back, and at dawn he started off to accept the money which the dwarf had offered him to repair his homestead. Isabel had been seized by ruffians while walking with her father, who appeared overcome with grief, and under the impression that Earnscliff was the offender; whereas Mr Ratcliffe, who managed his affairs, suggested that Sir Frederick had stronger motives for placing her under restraint. Mr Vere's suspicion seemed justified by their meeting his daughter returning under her lover's care; but she confirmed his version of the circumstances under which he had intervened, to the evident discomfiture of his rival and her father.\nAt a large gathering, the same day, of the Pretender's adherents in the hall of Ellieslaw Castle, Ralph Mareschal produced a letter which dissipated all their hopes, and Sir Frederick insisted that his marriage with Isabel should take place before midnight. She had consented, on her father's representation that his life would be forfeited if she refused, when Mr Ratcliffe persuaded her to make use of the token which Elshie had given her, and escorted her to his dwelling. He promised that at the foot of the altar he would redeem her; and, just as the ceremony was commencing in the chapel, a voice, which seemed to proceed from her mother's tomb, uttered the word \"Forbear.\" The dwarf's real name and rank were then revealed, as well as the circumstances under which he had acquired the power of thus interfering on Isabel's behalf, while Hobbie and his friends supported Mr Ratcliffe in dispersing the would-be rebels. Sir Edward at the same time disappeared from the neighbourhood, and Mr Vere retired, with an ample allowance, to the Continent, all the Ellieslaw property, as well as the baronet's, being settled on Earnscliff and his bride Isabel. Sir Frederick Langley was a few years afterwards executed at Preston, and Westburnflat earned a commission in Marlborough's army by his services in providing cattle for the commissariat.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "collect stones for a house"}], "question": "What did Earnscliff and Hobbie help Elshender do when they returned the next morning after having discovered him?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a rose"}], "question": "What object did Elshender give Isabel?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Forbear"}], "question": "What did the voice in the chapel say?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "his dog killed one of the dwarf's goats"}], "question": "Why did the dwarf warn Graeme of retribution?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "cattle"}], "question": "What were Earnscliff and his party tracking on the English border?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grace Anderson and cattle"}], "question": "What did Graeme and his party take from Hobbie's farm?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Isabel"}], "question": "Who was Graeme's prisoner?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grace had been returned"}], "question": "What did Elliot find when returning from Westburnflat's stronghold?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Earnscliff"}], "question": "Who did Isabel's father think had kidnapped Isabel?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was killed in a fight"}], "question": "What happened to Patrick Earnscliff's father?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Richard Vere"}], "question": "Who is the man that killed Patrick's father?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Patrick Earnscliff"}], "question": "Who did Isabel love?", "id": "2e3b266eda62694b15254616844a26d972f5939b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sir Frederick Langley"}], "question": "Who did Isabel's father intend for her to marry?

The advent of the bicycle stirred sudden and profound changes in the social life of England. Even the working class could travel substantial distances, quickly and cheaply, and the very idea of travelling for pleasure became a possibility for thousands of people for the first time. This new freedom affected many. It began to weaken the rigid English class structure and it gave an especially powerful boost to the existing movement toward female emancipation. Wells explored these social changes in his story.The hero of The Wheels of Chance, Mr. Hoopdriver, is a frustrated \"draper's assistant\" in Putney, a badly paid, grinding position (and one which Wells briefly held); and yet he owns a bicycle and is setting out on a bicycling tour of \"the Southern Coast\" on his annual ten days' holiday.\nHoopdriver survives his frustration by escaping in his imagination into a world of fantasy. He is not a skilled rider of his forty-three-pound bicycle, and his awkwardness reflects both Wells's own uncertainties in negotiating the English class system and his critical view of that society. Nonetheless, Hoopdriver is treated sympathetically: \"But if you see how a mere counter-jumper, a cad on castors, and a fool to boot, may come to feel the little insufficiencies of life, and if he has to any extent won your sympathies, my end is attained.\"\nHoopdriver's summer adventure begins lyrically:\nOnly those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all the year round, save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time, know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. All the dreary, uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall about your feet. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney Heath. The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill, and his heart sang within him.\nHoopdriver encounters a pretty young woman cycling alone and wearing rationals (bloomers). He dares not speak to the Young Lady in Grey, as he calls her, but their paths keep crossing. She is ultimately revealed to be Jessie Milton, a girl of seventeen who has run away from her stepmother in Surbiton, risking \"ruin\" at the hands of the bounder Bechamel, an unscrupulous older man who has promised to help the naive Jessie to establish herself an independent life but who is really intent on seducing her. Ironically, her flight has in part been inspired by liberal ideals of unconventionality that have been hypocritically promoted by her stepmother's popular novels.\nHoopdriver half-inadvertently rescues her from Bechamel's clutches, and the two proceed to cycle across the south of England. Ashamed of his true circumstances, Hoopdriver spins droll tales of South African origins and the comforts of wealth until shame induces him to confess his true circumstances. But he also displays genuine courage, rebuking insolent travellers who insult Jessie's honour.\nHoopdriver's encounter inspires in him a desire to better himself, as well as impossibly romantic feelings toward Jessie. At last a party consisting of her stepmother, some of her stepmother's admirers, and her former schoolteacher catches up with them. Jessie returns home and Hoopdriver returns to the Drapery Emporium of Messrs. Antrobus & Co., but Jessie has promised to \"send him some books\" and has held out the vague prospect that \"in six years' time\" things may be different.\nJessie's bookish and romantic education has kept her ignorant of the realities of life, and her ignorance contributes to the comedy of Hoopdriver's half-clever, half-ridiculous improvised stories of life in Africa. Jessie has her own aspirations: \"She was going to Live her Own Life, with emphasis.\" H.G. Wells's intention in The Wheels of Chance might be taken to be satirical, were his protagonists' circumstances not so closely related to his own history and that of his second wife, Catherine

employer. When Fait contacts Christophe, a Taiwanese Intelligence Agent named Su intercepts the conversation and attempts to identify the criminals.\nWhile the crew gathers up as many diamonds as they can, including a bag of black diamonds, Agent Su calls Fait and demands that he and his crew leave the diamonds in the vault, warning him that the police are on the way. However, Fait ignores this warning, and the criminals attempt a daring escape past a SWAT team blockade. While Fait, Daria, and Tommy all manage to escape, Agent Su captures Miles and recovers Miles' share of the diamonds. Su is disappointed to find that Miles does not have the black diamonds though. Meanwhile, Fait asks his friend Archie to appraise the black diamonds he had stolen. Arriving at the San Francisco International Airport, Christophe's mysterious employer, Ling, is informed, by his assistant Sona, that Christophe has been attacked and that Fait and his gang have taken the black diamonds.\nLater that night, Fait runs into Su. During this inadvertent meeting, Fait receives a phone call from Ling, who demands that Fait hand over the black diamonds. Fait refuses and is subsequently attacked by two of Ling's henchman. With Su's help, he defeats them and escapes. After the fight, Archie tells Fait that some gangsters came to his workshop and demanded the black diamonds as well. After some hesitation, Archie admits that he gave the stones to the gangsters to spare his own life. Fait also receives another call from Ling, who has kidnapped Fait's daughter, Vanessa, to persuade Fait to give up the diamonds. Now with a common enemy, Fait and Su team up to recover the diamonds from the gangsters and rescue Vanessa from Ling.\nFait visits jailed crime lord \"Jump\" Chambers, most likely the employer of the gangsters who had robbed Archie. When Chambers refuses to cooperate, Fait goes to Chambers' night club, hoping to find the stones somewhere in his office. The plan goes awry, and Fait and the gang have to leave empty-handed. Meanwhile, Su and Archie go to an underground club to try to find the gangsters who attacked Archie. Because the club does not allow guests, Su is forced to enter as a fighter in the club's fighting ring. During Su's fight, Archie sees the man they are looking for, recognizing the man's ring. Through this informant, they learn that the diamonds are hidden in the bubble bath in Chamber's office. When they return to the nightclub to retrieve the diamonds, they find that Ling's men have already taken the stones. Meanwhile, while locked in a van, the bound and gagged Vanessa frees herself, and finds a cell phone to call her father. Just before the phone's battery runs out, Vanessa gives some clues as to her location. With these clues, the gang surmises that Vanessa is being held in an airport hangar.\nRealizing that Ling will want to auction off the stones, which are actually weapons of mass destruction, the group searches flight schedules to find an airport where a large number of private flights will be landing that night. Finding the right airport, the group races to the hangar, where Ling's auction is already starting. A fight ensues, and Fait and his crew take out members of Ling's team. However, Vanessa is rescued and Ling is killed after Su forces him to swallow a capsule of synthetic plutonium and then breaks the capsule lodged in his neck. When the police arrive, Fait promises to end his criminal career in order to lead a safe and happy life with Vanessa.\nIn a bonus scene during the credits, Tommy and Archie made a plan to make the movie with their story, and using famous actors, such as Mel Gibson and Denzel Washington.

a soldier (Bill Hader), smoking marijuana, begins to reveal very graphically what he hates about the army, but still remains euphoric. A high-ranking officer (James Remar) immediately closes the project and deems marijuana illegal.\nJump ahead seventy years later, Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a 25-year-old process server and habitual marijuana smoker. He makes a visit to the home of his drug dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco), to buy marijuana. Saul tells him that he may already know the identity of Dale's next customer, Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Dale drives to Ted's house and witnesses Ted and a police officer, Officer Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez), shoot a man to death. Dale panics and flees the area, but leaves his roach at the scene, which contains a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express. Ted is able to identify the strain and sends his two henchmen, Budlofsky and Matheson (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson) to a dealer, Red (Danny McBride), who tells them that he has only sold the pot to Saul.\nDale flees to Saul's apartment and learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to Saul. Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Ted's henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul. They accidentally fall asleep in Dale's car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red. They leave the woods and arrive at Red's house, hoping to determine whether Ted has linked them with the Pineapple Express. Red says Ted isn't after them but Dale realizes that he's lying, and starts a fight that results in Red getting knocked out. They wake Red and question him until he reveals that Ted has discovered who they are and is going to kill them. Dale and Saul decide that they must leave the city.\nIn order to leave town, Dale and Saul sell some Pineapple Express to raise bus fare. However, a police officer named Barber (Cleo King) sees Dale and arrests him for selling marijuana. In the back of the cruiser, Dale tries to convince Barber that Brazier is corrupt and tells her that he witnessed her and Ted murder a man. Barber recognizes Brazier and promises him that she will investigate her soon. However, Saul leaps out in front of the police car and hijacks it thinking that Brazier is the one driving. Brazier hears a police radio call of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase but they manage to escape. After an argument with each other about the situation they are in, Dale and Saul go their separate ways. Saul visits his grandmother in an assisted living home but is kidnapped and held hostage in Ted's lair beneath a barn. Dale enlists Red to help him rescue Saul but Red unexpectedly backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are held hostage, they reconcile with each other and make plans to escape.\nSuddenly, Asian mobsters attack the barn to avenge a fellow gangster's death at the hands of Ted and Officer Brazier (the same murder that Dale witnessed). Dale and Saul finally free themselves but are caught by Matheson. Matheson grazes Dale's ear with a gunshot but is disarmed and shot by Saul. Dale and Saul join the fight and a brawl ensues between Dale and Ted. When Budlofsky refuses to kill Saul, Matheson emerges from the lair and shoots him in the chest, killing him. He turns around to kill Saul but Red drives through the barn and saves Saul by hitting Matheson with his car. Red is then seemingly shot to death by Brazier. One of the mobsters activate a bomb, resulting in Ted's death, and setting fire to the barn. When Red's car explodes, it flips over and lands on Brazier, killing her. The explosion incapacitates Saul but Dale finds him and carries him out of the burning barn. Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. Afterwards they eat breakfast at a diner and talk about their adventure before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Saul

Flaherty's tavern. There he claims that he is on the run because he killed his own father by driving a loy into his head. Flaherty praises Christy for his boldness, and Flaherty's daughter (and the barmaid), Pegeen, falls in love with Christy, to the dismay of her betrothed, Shawn Keogh. Because of the novelty of Christy's exploits and the skill with which he tells his own story, he becomes something of a town hero. Many other women also become attracted to him, including the Widow Quin, who tries unsuccessfully to seduce Christy at Shawn's behest. Christy also impresses the village women by his victory in a donkey race, using the slowest beast.\nEventually Christy's father, Mahon, who was only wounded, tracks him to the tavern. When the townsfolk realize that Christy's father is alive, everyone, including Pegeen, shuns him as a liar and a coward. To regain Pegeen's love and the respect of the town, Christy attacks his father a second time. This time it seems that Old Mahon really is dead, but instead of praising Christy, the townspeople, led by Pegeen, bind and prepare to hang him to avoid being implicated as accessories to his crime. Christy's life is saved when his father, beaten and bloodied, crawls back onto the scene, having improbably survived his son's second attack. As Christy and his father leave to wander the world, Shawn suggests he and Pegeen get married soon, but she spurns him.

As he walks NY he sky becomes a massive wave a surfer is riding.\nHe gets thrown out of a cafe but makes friends with Gina, the waitress; then he visits his vague mum in an institution to tell her he's getting married; his love is obvious wheras the marriage is not.\nHe catches up with Gina on the street and asks her to come to Mudd Club and she says he can call her. Theyre now sleeping together.\nWhen his park box bed collapses in the rain at night he visits Benny and they snort and get high. A prank call to a suicide line then set to music at the Mudd Club where he sees Gina through the crowd. They leave; he cant flag a cab so with a look to her she steps to the front and she can.\nWhile in a gallery working with an electrician painter he walks out after being bossed around by the owner, then peers into the art show opening. He's the SAMO graffitist.\nSurfing superimposition\nAs Benny and him are walking talking, a limo draws up and as they watch Andy Warhol and Bruno (art dealer) get out; Basquiat goes into the restaurant theyre in and sells them two of his postcards.\nHe's painting inside with black and white tv on when Gina wakes up and she loses her block; he's painted her dress and paintings but he comforts her back to happiness.\nSnorting at a high-rise drug den where some of them check out passers-by with a telescope which is used to find him after he's left for Rene who runs down in admiration of his talent.\nSure enough, the art shows, dealers and gallery owners start to be fixtures in his life.\nPeople are now coming by all the time while he paints and after he flirts with 'big pink' in the street he's nodding off then being slapped around to wake him up by Gina who sees a needle on the bedside table.\nBenny is noticing a change in Basquiat's attitude with his new found art world niche and storms out the taxi.\nThe arty-fartyness of it all is coming out as dealers and gallery owners fight for him and his work and he gains in admiration from limosine drivers. Rene loses his block at Mr Chou's after an exhibition opening and is forcibly removed.\nHis positive nature shoes through being interviewed by a rather condesceding amateur reporter.\nBicycling around, visiting Andy who is now his friend.\nHe and Gina catch up at a posh restaurant where a table of businessmen snigger and he checks his drug face blotches in the mirror. Andy relays that the gossip is Basquiat is killing himself but doesnt like the idea of him going to Hawaii and opening a tequilla shop; because Basquiat is a painter. Basquiat sends Andy a dreadlock helmet.\nBasquiat walking down the street, tries to join in with some graffiti-ists who take offence and bash him up.\nMore surf scenes \u2013 and blackness\nBasquiat walks into a studio where paintings are being hung; the owner sees him and the artist being hung \u2013 Milo -invites him to visit and tells him Andy does care, does know about art, and is concerned about Basquiat's drug habit.\nAfter Bruno tells Basquiat about Andy's death there's waterskiing footage with Basquiat writing TITA on what could be a skull or baseball \u2026 and footage of the real Andy and the acted Andy watched by Basquiat as tears start to come.\nHe tries to get his mum out of the convent in the middle of the night, then Benny finds him in his pjs and they drive through NY in an old jeep; we see his clogs are what he was painting\u00a0: TITANIC.\nWe hear him tell a story his mother used to tell him about a prince locked in a tower who couldnt get out and would bang his crowned head on the window bars to no avail; but the sound of the crown on the metal bars created the most beautiful sound for miles around. It filled everything and everyone up with beauty.\nLet's go to Ireland he says, stop in every pub and have a drink. The next screen gives his birthdate and that he died on August 12, 1988 at 27 years.\nThe movie is dedicated to Joe Glasgo 1925-96 who discovered Schnabel the director. While characters have been created for the movie story, so many elements \u2013 such as the crown \u2013 encourage further interest in Jean-Michel Basquiat.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0,

last stages of the Caucasian War. Tolstoy had a morally corrupt experience in his youth, engaging in numerous promiscuous partners, heavy drinking and gambling problems; many argue Tolstoy used his own past as inspiration for the protagonist Olenin.\nDisenchanted with his privileged life in Russian society, nobleman Dmitri Olenin joins the army as a cadet, in the hopes of escaping the superficiality of his daily life. On a quest to find \"completeness,\" he naively hopes to find serenity among the \"simple\" people of the Caucasus. In an attempt to immerse himself in the local culture, he befriends an old man. They drink wine, curse, and hunt pheasant and boar in the Cossack tradition, and Olenin even begins to dress in the manner of a Cossack. He forgets himself and falls in love with the young Maryanka, in spite of her fianc\u0102\u0160 Lukashka. While spending life as a Cossack, he learns lessons about his own inner life, moral philosophy, and the nature of reality. He also understands the intricacies of human psychology and nature.The young idealist Dmitriy Olenin leaves Moscow, hoping to start a new life in the Caucasus. In the stanitsa, he slowly becomes enamored by the surroundings and despises his previous existence. He befriends the old Cossack Eroshka, who goes hunting with him and finds him a good fellow because of his propensity to drinking. During this time, young Cossack Luka kills a Chechen who is trying to come across the river towards the village to scout the Cossacks and in this way gains much respect. Olenin falls in love with the maid Maryanka, who is to be wed to Luka later in the story. He tries to stop this emotion and eventually convinces himself that he loves both Luka and Maryanka for their simplicity and decides that happiness can only come to a man who constantly gives to others with no thought of self-gratification.\nHe first gives an extra horse to Luka, who accepts the present yet doesn't trust Olenin on his motives. As time goes on, however, though he gains the respect of the local villagers, another Russian named Beletsky, who is still attached to the ways of Moscow, comes and partially corrupts Olenin's ideals and convinces him through his actions to attempt to win Maryanka's love. Olenin approaches her several times and Luka hears about this from a Cossack, and thus does not invite Olenin to the betrothal party. Olenin spends the night with Eroshka but soon decides that he will not give up on the girl and attempts to win her heart again. He eventually, in a moment of passion, asks her to marry him, which she says she will answer soon.\nLuka, however, is severely wounded when he and a group of Cossacks go to confront a group of Chechens who are trying to attack the village, including the brother of the man he killed earlier. Though the Chechens lose after the Cossacks take a cart to block their bullets, the brother of the slain Chechen manages to shoot Luka in the belly when he is close by. As Luka seems to be dying and is being cared for by village people, Olenin approaches Maryanka to ask her to marry him; she angrily refuses. He realizes that \"his first impression of this woman's inaccessibility had been perfectly correct.\" He asks his company commander to leave and join the staff. He says goodbye to Eroshka, who is the only villager who sees him off. Eroshka is emotional towards Olenin but after Olenin takes off and looks back, he sees that Eroshka has apparently already forgotten about him and has gotten back to normal life.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he found out about Olenin's advances toward Maryanka."}], "question": "Why did Luka not invite Olenin to his betrothal party?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was trying to cross the river to scout the Cossacks."}], "question": "What was the Chechen that Luka killed attempting to do?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Their simplicity."}], "question": "What characteristic about Luka and Maryanka did Olenin love them both for?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The brother of the Chechen that Luka killed."}], "question": "Who shoots Luka in the belly?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They used a cart."}], "question": "How did the Cossacks block the bullets coming from the Chechens?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She told him she would answer him soon."}], "question": "How did Maryanka respond when Olenin asked her to marry him the first time?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To win her love."}], "question": "What does Beletsky convince Olenin to do concerning Maryanka?", "id": "31783db2180c4e27c1e7f920ce9433111cc676b2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To not think about self-indulgence.

Helium and Ptarth are both prominent Barsoomian city state/empires, and both Carthoris and Thuvia were secondary characters in the previous novel.\nIts plot devices are similar to the previous Martian novels, involving the kidnapping of a Martian princess. This time John Carter's son Carthoris is implicated. It does however have some inventive and original ideas, including an autopilot and collision detection device for Martian fliers, and the creation of the Lotharians, a race of ancient martians who have become adept at telepathic projection, able to create imaginary warriors that can kill, and sustain themselves through thought alone.Carthoris is madly in love with Thuvia. This love was foreshadowed at the end of the previous novel. Unfortunately Thuvia is promised to Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol. On Barsoom nothing can break an engagement between a man and woman except death, although the new suitor may not cause that death. Thus it is that Thuvia will have none of him. This situation leaves Carthoris in a predicament.\nAs Thuvia suffers the common Burroughsian heroine's fate of being kidnapped and in need of rescue, Carthoris' goal is abetted by circumstances. Thus he sets out to find the love of his life. His craft is sabotaged and he finds himself deep in the undiscovered south of Barsoom, in the ruins of ancient Aanthor. Thuvia's kidnappers, the Dusar, have taken her there as well, and Carthoris is just in time to spot Thuvia and her kidnappers under assault by a green man of the hordes of Torquas. Carthoris leaps to her rescue in the style of his father.\nThe rescue takes Carthoris and his love to ancient Lothar, home of an ancient fair-skinned human race gifted with the ability to create lifelike phantasms from pure thought. They habitually use large numbers of phantom bowmen paired with real and phantom banths (Barsoomian lions) to defend themselves from the hordes of Torquas.\nThe kidnapping of Thuvia is done in such a way that Carthoris is blamed. This ignites a war between the red nations of Barsoom. Carthoris must try to be back in time with Thuvia to stop the war from breaking loose. Carthoris wonders if his love will ever be requited by the promised Thuvia.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Carthoris"}], "question": "Who is blamed for the kidnapping of Thuvia?",

orphaned Scottish nobleman (loosely based on the 3rd Marquess of Bute) has been brought up in the legal guardianship of his Presbyterian uncle Lord Culloden and of a Catholic convert, Cardinal Grandison (based on H. E. Manning). When he comes of age Lothair finds himself the centre of attention of three fascinating women, Lady Corisande, Clare Arundel, and Theodora Campion, representing the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Radical cause respectively. Wavering in his allegiances, he unsuccessfully proposes marriage to Lady Corisande, almost joins the Catholic Church, and finally joins Theodora in Italy as a volunteer in the army of Garibaldi, which is fighting to take the Papal States for Italy. Theodora is killed at Viterbo, and Lothair is seriously wounded at the Battle of Mentana, but is nursed back to health by Clare Arundel, who tries to persuade him that he was saved by an apparition of the Virgin Mary. He takes refuge with the bohemian dandy Mr. Phoebus (a thinly disguised Frederic Leighton), who takes him to Syria, which, as the cradle of Christianity, seems the ideal place to reflect on the roots of the Faith. In Jerusalem he meets Paraclete, a mystic who teaches him that there is truth in many religions. Lothair decides in favour of the Church of England, resisting the attempts of Cardinal Grandison and other prelates, including Mgr Catesby (a thinly disguised Thomas Capel) to convert him to

an elaborate party being planned by his eldest daughter Allison. He begins to hear mysterious voices, which he tries with increasing difficulty to ignore. His youngest daughter Susan, an internal medicine resident, is involved with one of Bill's board members, Drew. She is considering marriage, but her father can tell she's not passionately in love. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, \"Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!\"\nSusan meets a vibrant young man at a coffee shop. She is instantly enamored but fails to even get his name. Minutes after their encounter (but unbeknownst to her), the man is struck by multiple cars in what appears to be a fatal motor vehicle accident. Death arrives at Bill's home in the body of the young man, explaining that Bill's impassioned speech has piqued his interest. Given Bill's \"competence, experience, and wisdom,\" Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth, he will not have to die. Making up a name on the spot, Death is introduced to the family as \"Joe Black.\"\nBill's best efforts to navigate the next few days\u00e2\u0080\u0094knowing them now to be his last\u00e2\u0080\u0094fail to keep events from going rapidly out of his control. Drew is secretly conspiring with a man bidding for Parrish Communications. He capitalizes on Bill's strange behavior and unexplained reliance on Joe Black to convince the board to vote him out as Chairman, using information given to him inadvertently by Bill's son-in-law, Quince, to push through approval for the merger which Bill had decided to oppose. Quince is devastated.\nAlthough confused by the sudden reappearance of Joe, believing him to be the young man from the coffee shop, Susan eventually falls deeply in love with him. Joe is now under the influence of human desires and becomes attracted to her as well. Bill angrily confronts him about his relationship with his daughter, but Death (personified in Joe) declares his intention to take Susan with him for his own.\nAs his last birthday arrives, Bill appeals to Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and all it encompasses\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially honesty and sacrifice. Joe comes to understand that he must set aside his own desire and allow Susan to live her life. He also helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by \"revealing\" himself to be an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail.\nBill devotes his remaining hours of life to his daughters at the party. Joe says a last goodbye to Susan, who seems to finally sense his true purpose and identity. As fireworks appear in the distance, Susan watches as Joe and her father walk out of view. Bill expresses to Joe, trepidation; but Joe assures him that in this \"future\" (while it may be unknown to him), he has nothing to fear. After a few moments (with both her father and \"Joe\" now gone), Joe reappears, alone. Death appears to have departed (with Bill), leaving Susan's young man from the coffee shop, unaware of how he got to Susan's father's party. While Susan (in this new reality's timeline), is now both aware of (and accepting), that her father has gone; and she welcomingly reignites the mutual bonding with the man she had met in the coffee shop (and who had \"disappeared\"; a few days earlier). During their conversation, there are hints to the audience whether or not the man is truly the young man from the coffee shop, or is it really still Death. Susan asks, \"What do we do now?\" (A question that took place between her and Death/Joe earlier on).

Through her father and her worldly, cheerful cousin, Lady Monica Knollys, she gradually learns more regarding her uncle, Silas Ruthyn, a black sheep of the family whom she has never met; once an infamous rake and gambler, he is now apparently a fervently reformed Christian. His reputation has been tainted by the suspicious suicide of a man to whom Silas owed an enormous gambling debt, which took place within a locked, apparently impenetrable room in Silas's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.\nIn the first part of the novel, Maud's father hires a French governess, Madame de la Rougierre, as a companion for her. Madame de la Rougierre terrifies Maud and appears to have designs on her; during two of their walks together, Maud is brought into suspicious contact with strangers that seem to be known to Madame de la Rougierre. (In a cutaway scene that breaks the first-person narrative, we learn that she is in league with Uncle Silas's good-for-nothing son Dudley.) The governess is eventually dismissed when she is discovered by Maud in the act of burgling her father's desk.\nMaud is asked in obscure terms by her father if she is willing to undergo some kind of \"ordeal\" to clear the name of her uncle, and of the family more generally; shortly after she assents, he dies. At the reading of his will, it emerges that her father added a codicil to it: Maud is to stay with Uncle Silas until she comes of age; if she dies whilst still a minor, the estate will pass to Silas. Lady Knollys, together with Austin's executor and fellow Swedenborgian, Dr. Bryerly, attempt in vain to overturn the codicil, realizing its many dangerous implications for the young heiress; despite their efforts, Maud consents willingly to spending the next three and a half years at her uncle's mansion at Bartram-Haugh.\nMaud initially finds life at Bartram-Haugh strange but not unpleasant, despite ominous signs such as the uniformly unfriendly servants and a malevolent factotum of Silas's, the one-legged Dickon Hawkes. Silas himself frightens Maud but is nonetheless seemingly kind to her, in contrast to his treatment of his own children, the loutish Dudley and the uneducated Millicent ('Milly'). Initially deprecating of her rustic mannerisms, Maud and Millicent become best friends, and each other's only source of companionship at the estate. During her stay, Maud is subject to various attempts by Dudley to court her, but she rejects him thoroughly on each occasion. Silas is periodically subject to mysterious catatonic fits, attributed to his massive opium consumption.\nVarious ominous happenings begin to take place at Bartram-Haugh; it becomes increasingly difficult for Maud and Millicent to find any route out of the estate; meanwhile, Dudley's courtship culminates in a marriage proposition to Maud; when she confronts Silas about it, he attempts to coax her into accepting. She is relieved when it emerges that Dudley is already married, and when, after being disowned by his father, he and his wife leave to set sail from Liverpool to New York. It is afterwards decided that Millicent should attend a boarding school in France, and Silas sends her away with the promise that Maud is to join her after three months.\nIn the meantime, Maud is shocked to discover Madame de la Rougierre residing at Bartram-Haugh in the employ of Silas, and she suspects also that Dudley may not have fled. Despite strong protest by Maud, Madame is charged with accompanying her first to London, and then on to Dover and across the Channel. After falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, Maud awakes to find herself again at Bartram-Haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to London and back. Maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of Madame de la Rougierre, whilst everyone suspects she is in France. Remembering the earlier warnings of her cousin, Lady Knollys, she refuses to drink any of the drugged claret intended for her; instead, Madame de la Rougierre, ignorant of Silas' true intentions, partakes of it and promptly falls asleep on Maud's bed. Later that night, Dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room; the window he uses is set upon concealed hinges that allow it to be opened only from the outside. Hidden out of sight, Maud witnesses Dudley brutally murder Madame de la Rougierre by mistake in the near-darkness. Uncle Silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, Maud slips out undetected. Assisted by Dickon Hawkes' daughter, whom Maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to Lady Knolly's estate, and away from Bartram-Haugh.\nSilas is discovered in the morning lying dead of an opium overdose, while Dudley becomes a fugitive and is thought to be hiding in Australia. Maud is happily married to the charming and handsome Lord Ilbury and ends her recollections on a philosophical note:\nThis world is a parable\u00e2\u0080\u0094the habitation of symbols\u00e2\u0080\u0094the phantoms of spiritual things immortal shown in material shape.

As they try to rescue Sarah, part of her harness breaks, and though Gabe is able to grab her, her gloved hand slips out, and she falls to her death. Hal blames Gabe for her death and Gabe is overcome with guilt, taking an extended leave.\nEight months later, Gabe returns to the ranger station to gather his remaining possessions and convince Jessie to leave with him. While there, they receive a distress call from a group of stranded climbers. Hal goes to locate the climbers and Jessie is able to convince Gabe to help out. Hal remains bitter towards Gabe over Sarah's death, at one point threatening to send Gabe over a ledge. When they find the climbers, they discover the distress call was a ruse and are taken prisoner by former Military Intelligence operative Eric Qualen and several mercenaries. Qualen, along with turncoat U.S. Treasury agent Richard Travers, were able to steal three suitcases full of uncirculated bills valuing over $100 million. Their escape plan backfired, sending their plane crashing into the mountain, and they now require Gabe and Hal's help to locate the cases with the help of beacon locators.\nAt gunpoint, Gabe leads them to the first case, located at the top of a steep rock face. They force Gabe to tether himself to reach it, and Gabe uses the opportunity to escape. The mercenaries attempt to fire on Gabe, which causes an avalanche that kills one of their members. When they see the money from the first case fluttering away, Qualen believes Gabe is dead, and orders Hal to lead them onward. Gabe races ahead to find Jessie at an abandoned cabin. They recover old mountaineering gear to reach the second case before Qualen does. By the time Qualen arrives, Gabe and Jessie have emptied the case and left only a single bill with the taunting message \"Want to trade?\" on it. Qualen orders his men to split up, allowing Gabe to dispatch two more of Qualen's men. Gabe attempts to call for help from Frank, their rescue helicopter pilot, on one of the mercenaries' radios, but Hal alerts him to explosives Qualen has rigged above them on the mountain. Gabe and Jessie escape the falling debris in time. Elsewhere, when Hal sees two friends, Evan and Brett, he warns them away before Qualen orders his men to open fire. Brett is killed while Evan is wounded, though he manages to ski off the mountain and parachute to safety. Night falls on the mountain and both groups take shelter. Frank, having not heard from Gabe or the others, scouts the mountain in the helicopter, spots Evan's parachute, and is able to get him to safety while contacting the authorities.\nWhen morning breaks, Gabe and Jessie beat Qualen to the last case. Meanwhile, the mercenaries flag down Frank in the helicopter, and by the time he realizes it's a trap it is too late. He is shot by one of the mercenaries and dies, but not before slipping Hal a knife. As the mercenaries split up to look for the other case, Hal is able to use the knife to wound one of the mercenaries, kill him with his own gun, and escape. Elsewhere Hal finds Gabe, and together they kill Travers. However, at the same time, Qualen takes Jessie hostage when she waves down the helicopter, believing that Frank was flying it. Qualen tells Gabe and Hal over the radio that he is holding Jessie captive on board the helicopter, demanding Gabe and Hal to surrender the money from the third case at a high elevated rendezvous point and threatens to kill her should they refuse to cooperate.\nGabe and Hal agree, and they meet at a cliff side bridge. However, Qualen tries to challenge Gabe into throwing the case into the helicopter, but when he also threatens to kill Jessie again, Gabe orders Qualen to free her at a safe distance away from the cliff. Qualen reluctantly agrees, and uses a winch to lower Jessie to the ground. Once Jessie is safely down, however, Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter's rotors, shredding the money. Enraged, Qualen attempts to fly off, but Gabe has used the winch cable to tether the helicopter to a steel ladder up the cliff face. The ladder snaps and leaves Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage of the helicopter hanging by the cable. Gabe fights Qualen and manages to climb to safety as the wreckage snaps off the cable, sending Qualen to his death.

The run ends with a jump onto a lone stone column, where Jeff overshoots the landing and falls to his death.\nSeven years later, Utah is an FBI agent candidate. He attends a briefing on a skyscraper heist, in which the criminals steal diamonds, escaping by parachute, in Mumbai. A similar heist happens over Mexico where the criminals unload millions of dollars in bills over Mexico, then disappear into the Cave of Swallows. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah is sent undercover to France under a field agent named Pappas (Ray Winstone). They reach France and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave.\nAs he goes in, there is already another surfer in the wave, leaving Utah with an unstable wave. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints, but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the surfer, Bodhi (\u0102\u0089dgar Ram\u0102\u00adrez), and his team Roach (Clemens Schick), Chowder (Tobias Santelmann), and Grommet (Matias Varela). They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl, Samsara (Teresa Palmer). The next day, Utah finds the men in an abandoned Paris train station after he overhears them talk about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he is accepted in the circle. They travel to the Alps for the next ordeal, wingsuit flying through the cliffs \"The Life of Wind\". The four succeed in their attempt and spend some time together with Samsara. The next day, they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding through a steep wall of snow. They reach their spot, but Utah decides to extend his line so the others follow him. Chowder slips and falls to his death, and Utah becomes depressed about it.\nAfter a party, Samsara explains that she and Bodhi both knew Ono Ozaki when they were young, that her parents died in an avalanche accident and Ozaki gave her a home after. She explains further that Ozaki actually completed his third ordeal, as was widely believed. He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a whaling ship crashing into his boat while he was trying to save humpback whales. On his boat, a young boy, Bodhi, decided not to tell the truth of his story but to finish what Ozaki started.\nNext they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. Bodhi escapes as Utah cannot stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi's sponsors' assets; Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them, revealed to be Samsara.\nUtah finds the location of the next ordeal: solo rock climbing with no safety beside a waterfall Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet cramps and falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he leaps down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal as he bailed out on the wave when he had to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him, and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi and Utah continues his career in the FBI, and starts to go through his own eight ordeals.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "France"}], "question": "Utah is sent undercover to where?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pappas"}], "question": "What is his undercover name while in France?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Samsara"}], "question": "Who does Utah shoot at the Italian bank?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He falls to his death"}], "question": "What happens to Jeff while biking and he overshoots his landing?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seven years"}], "question": "How long after Jeff's death before we see Utah again?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An FBI agent."}], "question": "What job is Utah going for in the beginning of the story?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "While surfing, Bodhi rescues Utah."}], "question": "How does Utah meet Bodhi?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "With an initiation fight."}], "question": "How does Utah get accepted into the circle of the three criminals?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In an avalanche accident."}], "question": "How did Samsara's parents die?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "When a whaling ship crashed into his boat."}], "question": "How did Ozaki die?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Eight historic extreme ordeals to honor nature."}], "question": "What is the Ozkai 8?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "France"}], "question": "What country does Utah go undercover in?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Chowder"}], "question": "Who dies while completing the 6th ordeal?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ono Ozaki"}], "question": "Who did Samsara and Bodhi both know?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It would have been the last ordeal."}], "question": "Why did Bodhi leap down the waterfall?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The fourth ordeal"}], "question": "Which ordeal does Bodhi have to redo?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "17 months"}], "question": "How long does it take Utah to find Bodhi again?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Samsara"}], "question": "Who gets shot by Utah?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In the Pacific "}], "question": "Where does Utah find Bodhi?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He passes an initiation fight."}], "question": "How does Utah get accepted into the circle?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Parachutes."}], "question": "How do the criminals escape the skyscraper heist?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Surfing a giant wave in France."}], "question": "What is the 4th extreme ordeal?", "id": "35592c2abea624d315c5171d67ab5e14794ca071"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bohdi"}], "question": "Who saves Utah when he faints while surfing?

He is confronted by a mysterious figure whom he calls \"Keyser\", who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship,\nThe bloodbath on the ship leaves only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash, a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns; and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, a con artist with cerebral palsy. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies in from New York City to interrogate Verbal, who describes in flashback the events that led him and four other criminals - Keaton, Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockney - onto the ship.\nVerbal explains that, six weeks earlier in New York, he and the other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped-up hijacking charge, and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police. Led by Keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they robbed a group of corrupt cops who transported smugglers in a police convoy. They then went to California to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named Redfoot. Redfoot turned them on to another jewel heist, but the quarry turned out to be heroin, and the five had to shoot their way out. Soon after, a lawyer named Kobayashi contacted them and told them that Keyser S\u00f6ze, a Turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen (including Hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in New York), had offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers with whom S\u00f6ze was competing and destroy the $91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting.\nWhen Kujan learns of S\u00f6ze from FBI agent Jack Baer, he questions Verbal about him. Verbal tells Kujan an underworld legend about S\u00f6ze: that he had murdered his own family after they had been attacked by a gang of Hungarian criminals, and then massacred the Hungarians and everyone they held dear. He then went underground, never to be seen again, and did business only through underlings who did not know for whom they were working. He became a fearsome urban legend, \"a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night\".\nVerbal goes on to explain that, after Fenster had bailed on the group, Kobayashi gave them a location at which to find their compatriot's dead body. They tried to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones. They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as Verbal looked on.\nVerbal concludes his story, but Kujan does not believe it. He insists that Keaton must be S\u00f6ze, as one of the murder victims on the boat was Arturo Marquez, a drug dealer who escaped prosecution by claiming he could identify S\u00f6ze \u2014 and who was represented by Edie Finneran, Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend. Kujan claims that the Argentinians were selling Marquez to S\u00f6ze's Hungarian rivals and Keaton used the heist as a distraction to let him kill Marquez. Kujan also informs Verbal that Finneran has been murdered. Verbal says that the entire plan was Keaton's idea, but refuses to testify in court. Verbal's bond is posted and he is released.\nMoments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal's entire story was a lie, pieced together from details on a crowded bulletin board in his office. Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually dropping his limp and flexing his supposedly withered hand. As Kujan runs after Verbal, a fax comes in from California: a police sketch artist's rendering of S\u00f6ze, dictated by Kovash, that looks exactly like Verbal. Kujan misses Verbal by moments, as the latter disappears into a car driven by \"Kobayashi\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "San Pedro Bay"}], "question": "Where is the ship

in technological advancement that enables colonization of the far reaches of the universe. Armed with artificially intelligent \"Thermostellar Triggering Devices\", the scout ship \"Dark Star\" and its crew have been alone in space for 20 years on a mission to destroy \"unstable planets\" which might threaten future colonization of other planets.\nThe ship's crew consists of Lt. Doolittle (helmsman, and initially, second-in-command), Sgt. Pinback (bombardier), Cpl. Boiler (navigator), and Talby (target specialist). \"Dark Star\" Commander Powell was killed during hyperdrive as a result of an electrical short behind his rear seat panel, but remains onboard ship in a state of cryogenic suspension. The crew members perform their jobs with abject boredom, as the tedium of their tasks over 20 years has driven them \"around the bend.\" The \"Dark Star\" ship is in a constant state of deterioration and frequent system malfunctions (for example, a radiation leak which is not repairable, their cargo of intelligent talking bombs lowering from their bomb bay without a command to do so, an explosion destroying their sleeping quarters, the food processing computer repeatedly serving chicken-flavored liquid meals, and a storage bay \"self destructing\" and destroying the ship's entire supply of toilet paper), and only the soft-spoken female voice of the ship's computer for company. They have created distractions for themselves: Doolittle, formerly a surfer from Malibu, California, has constructed a musical bottle organ; Talby spends his time in the ship's observation dome, content to watch the universe go by; Boiler obsessively trims his moustache, enjoys smoking cigars, and shoots targets with the ship's emergency laser rifle in a corridor; while Pinback plays practical jokes on the crew members, maintains a video diary, and has adopted a ship's mascot in the form of a mischievous \"beachball\"-like alien who refuses to stay in a storage room, forcing Pinback to chase it around the ship. With regard to Pinback, he may not actually be \"Sgt. Pinback\" at all; in his video diary, he states he is liquid fuel specialist Bill Froug, who inadvertently took the \"real\" Sgt. Pinback's place on the mission. It is unclear, however, whether or not this is a paranoid illusory fiction Sgt Pinback has created, due to his prolonged time working in deep space.\nEn route to their next target (the Veil Nebula), the \"Dark Star\" is hit by a bolt of electromagnetic energy during a storm, resulting in yet another on-board malfunction, with \"Thermostellar Bomb #20\" receiving an order to deploy. With some difficulty, the ship's computer convinces Bomb #20 that the order was in error, and persuades the bomb to disarm itself and return to the bomb bay. Talby notes the malfunction, and decides to investigate the fault (to the complete disinterest of his crew mates), and discovers a damaged communications laser in the emergency airlock while the crew is engaging their next bombing run. While attempting to repair it the laser malfunctions, blinding Talby and knocking him unconscious, inadvertently triggering a more serious problem, causing extensive damage to the ship's main computer, and damaging the bomb release mechanism on Bomb #20.\nDue to the damaged ship's computer, the crew members discover that they cannot activate the release mechanism and attempt to abort the drop. To make matters worse, after two prior accidental deployments, and intent on exploding as it was programmed to do, Bomb #20 refuses to disarm or abort the countdown sequence. As Pinback and Boiler try to talk the bomb out of blowing up underneath the ship, Doolittle revives Commander Powell, who advises him to talk to the bomb, and to teach the bomb the rudiments of phenomenology. After donning a space suit and exiting the ship to approach the bomb directly, Doolittle engages in a philosophical conversation with Bomb #20 until it decides to abort its countdown and retreat to the bomb bay for further contemplation. Disaster appears to have been averted, but when attempting to re-enter the ship, Doolittle inadvertently jettisons Talby out of the airlock. As Doolittle tries to rescue the now-conscious Talby as he floats away from the \"Dark Star,\" Pinback addresses the bomb over the intercom in another attempt to disarm it.\nUnfortunately, Doolittle has mistakenly taught the bomb Cartesian doubt and, as a result, Bomb #20 determines that it can only trust itself and not external input. Convinced that only it exists, and that its sole purpose in life is to explode, Bomb #20 states \"Let there be light,\" and promptly detonates. Pinback and Boiler are killed instantly. Commander Powell is jettisoned into space encased in ice, and Talby and Doolittle are blown in opposite trajectories, drifting away from each other. Talby drifts into the Phoenix Asteroids (a cluster of glowing asteroids he has long had a fascination with), destined to circumnavigate the universe for eternity. As Doolittle loses contact with Talby, he sees that he is falling toward the unstable planet. Realizing he will burn in the atmosphere, he drifts into debris from the \"Dark Star,\" finds an appropriately surfboard-shaped hunk of debris, and \"surfs\" down into the atmosphere of the planet, dying as a falling star.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A scout ship in deep space.

A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich (Karel Roden), plans a crooked land deal, and London's crooks all want a piece of it. Other key players include the underhand accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) and ambitious small-time crook One-Two (Gerard Butler) leading a group called the \"Wild Bunch\" which includes Mumbles (Idris Elba) and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy).\nLenny charges Uri \u00e2\u0082\u01797,000,000 for the crooked deal; Uri has his accountant Stella find funds. Uri lends his lucky painting to Lenny as a sign of friendship. Stella, however, double-crosses Uri and tips off the Wild Bunch to steal the money, while the painting is stolen from Lenny's wall by his junkie rocker stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), who disappears. Lenny and Archy coerce his former managers Mickey (Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges) and Roman (Jeremy Piven) into tracking down Johnny. Handsome Bob also gets close to a lawyer who has information on a prevalent undercover informer in their criminal circle.\nAfter Uri's money is stolen by the Wild Bunch a second time, his assistant Victor begins to suspect that it is Lenny who has been stealing the money and purposely keeping Uri's painting from him to resell it. This theory enrages Uri, who lures Lenny to a private golf game in order to break his leg, warning him to return his painting without delay.\nCookie (Matt King) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella (after a sexual encounter) as a token of appreciation. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen but is rescued, and then kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.\nUri wants to marry Stella, whom he has long admired. At Stella's house he proposes, but he spots the painting. Stella lies and says she has had it for years. Uri, enraged by this and realizing that Stella betrayed him, orders Victor to kill her.\nArchy brings Johnny, Roman, Mickey and the Wild Bunch to Lenny's warehouse where Lenny orders Johnny executed. He demands that the Wild Bunch tell him where the money is or else they will be killed \"very slowly\". Handsome Bob offers the legal documents concerning the informant in his pocket to Archy. Archy recognizes the pseudonym used on documents, \"Sydney Shaw\", as belonging to Lenny. Lenny arranged with the police to routinely lock up many criminal associates (including Archy himself) for years at a time in order to enhance his own standing in the criminal underworld and to ensure his own freedom. Archy orders Lenny's men to free the Wild Bunch and has Lenny drowned and fed to crayfish.\nIn the lift, Johnny graphically explains to Roman and Mickey that they will also be killed in order to leave no witnesses, and graphically explains the manner of their executions. His description unnerves the man who's to execute the three men, prompting him to act prematurely. Having also already anticipated this move, Johnny warns Mickey and Roman to intervene and kill their would-be executioner. Johnny shoots two more men waiting at the top of the lift and they escape the last of Archy's men (with the help of the Wild Bunch).\nLater, Archy picks up Johnny from rehab. Archy gives Uri's lucky painting to Johnny as a peace offering. Archy says that obtaining the painting \"cost a very wealthy Russian an arm and a leg\" implying he had Uri killed. Johnny proclaims that, with his new-found freedom from addiction and his father, he will do what he could not before: \"become a real RocknRolla\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash's son helps them escape.\nThey pick up Tommy Johnson, a young black man. Tommy claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit.\nNear a river, the group hears singing. They see three women washing clothes and singing. The women drug them with corn whiskey and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the women were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.\nEverett and Delmar arrive in Everett's home town. Everett confronts his wife Penny, who changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead. He gets into a fight with Vernon T. Waldrip, her new \"suitor.\" They later see Pete working on a chain gang. Later that night, they sneak into Pete's holding cell and free him. As it turns out, the women had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities. Under torture, Pete gave away the treasure's location to the police. Everett then confesses that there is no treasure. He made it up to convince the guys he was chained with to escape with him. Pete is enraged at Everett, because he had two weeks left on his original sentence, and must serve fifty more years for the escape.\nThe trio stumble upon a Ku Klux Klan rally, who are planning to hang Tommy. The trio disguises themselves as Klansmen and attempt to rescue Tommy. However, Big Dan, a Klan member, reveals their identities. Chaos ensues, and the Grand Wizard reveals himself as Homer Stokes, a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross. The cross falls on Big Dan, killing him.\nEverett convinces Pete, Delmar and Tommy to help him win his wife back. They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending, disguised as musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd drives him out on a rail. Pappy O'Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to marry Everett with the condition that he find her original ring.\nThe next morning, the group sets out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, where Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town.

He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away.\nWhale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions.\nBoone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \"locker room\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with \"his Monsters\": Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from \"ancient\" movie fame. This event exacerbates his depression. A sudden rain storm becomes an excuse to leave.\nBack at Whale's home, Boone needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Boone wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Boone one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Boone, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. After Boone drops his towel to pose nude, Whale makes him wear a World War I gas mask and then uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Boone, kissing his shoulder. Boone becomes enraged and attacks Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Boone to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Boone refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she can't find Whale, prompting a search by Boone and Hanna. Boone finds Whale floating dead in the pool, as a distraught Hanna runs out clutching a suicide note. Boone and Hanna agree that Boone should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal.\nThe film closes roughly a decade later as Boone and his young son, Michael, watch The Bride of Frankenstein on television. The son is skeptical of his father's claim that he knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, \"To Clayton. Friend?\" \"Friend?\", being a plea from the original misfit, Frankenstein's monster, and disclosing Whale's true intentions.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Strokes"}], "question": "What medical condition did Whale continue to suffer from?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gardener"}], "question": "What job was Boone hired to do for Whale?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester"}], "question": "Who are the two \"monsters\" mentioned in the story?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Michael"}], "question": "What is Boone's son's name?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "George Cukor"}], "question": "Who hosted the party, mentioned in the story, for Princess Margaret?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A rain storm"}], "question": "What happens at Princess Margaret's party that is an excuse for Whale and Boone to leave?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hanna"}], "question": "Who is Whale's longtime housemaid?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein"}], "question": "What pieces of work did Whale famously direct?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pose for his drawings"}], "question": "What did Boone do to help Whale?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dead in the pool"}], "question": "After Whale and Boone's disagreement where did Hanna find Whale?", "id": "3753ff3da0842f8a1609e3cee8bb506c3b5b63f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was the director of the films Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein"}], "question": "What is James Whale's claim to fame?

Frank Parnell (Fox Harris). The cop opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind.\nOtto Maddox (Emilio Estevez), a young punk rocker living in Los Angeles, is fired from his boring job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) drives up and offers him $25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood.\nOtto follows Bud in the car to the \"Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation\" (a small automobile repossession agency), where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a repossession agent, or \"repo man\", and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out, pot-smoking, ex-hippie parents (Jonathan Hugger, Sharon Gregg) have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job.\nOtto soon learns that, as Bud had told him, \"the life of a repo man is always intense.\" He enjoys the fast living, drug use, car chases, hot-wiring cars, and good pay. His old life is boring by comparison.\nAfter repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila (Olivia Barash) running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet (\"UFO\"...), where they have sex in the backseat. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dead but still dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand and its repo rivals are offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual worth of the car.\nParnell finally arrives in L.A., but he is unable to meet up with his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When he pulls into a gas station, the Rodriguez brothers (competitors of Helping Hand) take the car. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto's punk friends, who are on a crime spree (what they call \"doing crimes\"), steal the Malibu.\nAfter they visit a night club, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away, allowing him to take the car back. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, talking about how a brilliant scientist friend gave himself a lobotomy to deal with his work, then reveals his friend drives a Chevy Malibu before collapsing and dying from radiation exposure. Otto takes the car back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen from the lot, and a chase ensues with all the characters involved. By this time, the car is glowing bright green. Eventually, the car reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, however he ends up being shot and leaves the car; the various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up - government agents, the UFO scientists, and even the televangelist Otto's parents gave his college funds to. However, anyone who now approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits. Only Miller, an eccentric mechanic who works at Helping Hand, is able to approach and enter the car. He slides behind the wheel, apparently impervious to the radiation. He beckons Otto into the Malibu, and Otto accepts eagerly, dismissing Leila's confession of love (at which point she calls him a \"shithead\" and says \"I'm glad I tortured you.\"). After he settles into the passenger seat, the Malibu lifts straight up into the air.

Archie's attempts to ingratiate himself with Brewster only get him further into trouble. The story takes place in New York City.Archie Moffam is an Englishman in New York. Like Bertie Wooster he\u2019s kind hearted but mentally limited, if not negligible. Unlike Bertie he has no private income. He\u2019s a veteran of the First World War.\nDuring a stay in New York he bitterly criticises the service at the Cosmopolis Hotel, thus making an enemy of its owner, Daniel Brewster. On a subsequent trip to Miami he meets, falls in love with and marries Brewster\u2019s daughter Lucille. Brewster is not delighted. Archie\u2019s attempts to make amends by finding employment and by purchasing a valuable objet d\u2019art for Brewster end in disaster. Further indiscretions follow for Archie: he upsets Lucille by apparently paying too much attention to an actress; he bets $1000 on the Giants (then a New York baseball team), but gets into a fight with their star pitcher and injures his arm. He advises Lucille\u2019s brother, Bill, who has a habit of getting into relationships with girls of whom his father disapproves, and lends a hand to an old comrade from the war, \u201cThe Sausage Chappie\u201d, who\u2019s lost his memory and forgotten his own name. He upsets Mrs Cora Bates McCall, a vegetarian and healthy food campaigner, by persuading her son to take part in a pie-eating contest. Then there\u2019s an incident with a painting which further upsets Brewster. Eventually he pacifies the old curmudgeon by telling him he\u2019s about to become a grandfather.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It takes place in New York City."}], "question": "Where does the story take place?", "id": "3988c295053fe9eb18747b735259fe78a7e760fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Archie is a World War I veteran."}], "question": "What war is Archie a veteran of?", "id": "3988c295053fe9eb18747b735259fe78a7e760fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He criticizes the service at a hotel owned by Brewster."}], "question": "How does Archie initially anger Daniel Brewster?", "id": "3988c295053fe9eb18747b735259fe78a7e760fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Archie meets Lucille in Miami."}], "question": "Where does Archie meet Brewster's daughter?", "id": "3988c295053fe9eb18747b735259fe78a7e760fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He bets on the Giants.

In exchange for the Germans agreeing to leave his family alone for the rest of the war, La Padite reveals that the Dreyfus family is hidden under the floor. Landa orders SS soldiers to shoot through the floorboards. The family is killed except for Shosanna, a young woman who escapes.\nThree years later, Lieutenant Aldo Raine of the First Special Service Force recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the Basterds, who spread fear among the German soldiers by killing and scalping them. The Basterds also recruit Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, a German soldier who murdered thirteen Gestapo officers. Adolf Hitler interviews a German soldier, Private Butz, the only survivor of a Basterd attack on his squad. Raine carved the letter T into Butz's forehead with a knife so he could never hide that he voted for an avowed fascist.\nShosanna is operating a cinema in Paris under an assumed name. She meets Fredrick Zoller, a German sniper who killed 250 soldiers in a single battle; Zoller is to star in a Nazi propaganda film, Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with Shosanna, Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of the film at her cinema. Shosanna plots with her projectionist and lover, Marcel, to kill the Nazi leaders attending the premiere by setting the cinema ablaze.\nUnknown to Shosanna, British Army Lieutenant Archie Hicox is working with the Basterds to plan an attack on the same premiere. Hicox goes to a tavern with Hugo Stiglitz and Basterd Wilhelm Wicki to meet an undercover agent, the German film star Bridget von Hammersmark. Hicox gives himself away by ordering three drinks and gesturing \"three\" with his hand (with thumb and pinky finger down); Gestapo Major Dieter Hellstrom knows that Germans gesture \"three\" with the thumb and first two fingers extended. Discovered, and the Basterds open fire, killing everyone in the tavern except Wilhelm and a wounded Hammersmark. Raine arrives and negotiates with Wilhelm for Hammersmark's release, but the she kills Wilhelm when he lowers his guard. Raine learns from Hammersmark that Hitler himself will be attending the film premiere and decides to continue the mission. Later, Landa investigates the aftermath at the tavern and finds one of Hammersmark's shoes and a napkin with her signature.\nAt the premiere, two of the Basterds, Donny Donowitz and Omar Ulmer, join Raine in posing as Italians, hoping to fool the Germans unfamiliar with the language. However, Landa, who speaks fluent Italian, converses briefly with the Basterds before sending Donowitz and Ulmer to their seats. He takes Hammersmark to a private room, verifies that the shoe from the tavern fits her, then strangles her to death. Raine and another of his men, Smithson \"The Little Man\" Utivich, are taken prisoner, but Landa has Raine contact his superior with the OSS and cuts a deal: he will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for immunity and rewards.\nDuring the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection room to see Shosanna. After she rejects his advances, he becomes aggressive. She pretends to acquiesce, then pulls a pistol from her bag and shoots him. Zoller, mortally wounded, raises his pistol and shoots her before they both die. As Stolz der Nation reaches its climax, spliced-in footage of Shosanna tells the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Marcel, having locked the doors of the cinema, ignites a pile of flammable nitrate film behind the screen as Shosanna's image laughs. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the box containing Hitler and Goebbels, killing them, then fire their submachine guns into the crowd until the bombs go off, killing everyone in the theater. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender.

Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (And Then There Were None) or all of the suspects (Murder on the Orient Express).\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of his deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as And Then There Were None and Endless Night, both rather nihilistic in nature).\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include The Witness for the Prosecution, Murder on the Orient Express, The Man in the Brown Suit, Elephants Can Remember, and The Unexpected Guest. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot, sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death on the Nile, Dumb Witness, Crooked House, The Hollow, The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Cat Among the Pigeons, Peril at End House, Nemesis, Appointment with Death, The Secret Adversary, and Curtain. In the last of these (Curtain), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\nIn The A.B.C. Murders, the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In And Then There Were None, the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in film and television productions, most famously the Charles Laughton/Marlene Dietrich film.) In Death Comes as the End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed in the act before he can claim another victim by one of the few surviving characters.\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as Five Little Pigs and Endless Night. According to P. D. James, Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.\nOn an edition of Desert Island Discs in 2007, Brian Aldiss claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person. However, John Curran's Agatha Christie: The Secret Notebooks describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Curtain"}], "question": "In which story do three plus culprits die?", "id": "39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "four"}], "question": "How many people did the murderer kill in \"The A.B.C.\" murders?", "id": "39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hercule Poirot"}], "question": "What is the name of the detective usually played in Christie's stories?", "id": "39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the murderer was killed"}], "question": "What change was made to the murderer in \"Witness for Protection\" when it was turned into a stage play?", "id": "39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "ancient Egypt"}], "question": "Where does \"Death Comes as an End\" take place?", "id": "39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "P.D.

Fifteen years earlier, he was falsely convicted and sentenced to penal transportation by the corrupt Judge Turpin, who lusted after Barker's wife Lucy. Barker adopts the alias \"Sweeney Todd\" and returns to his old Fleet Street shop, situated above Mrs. Nellie Lovett's meat pie shop. He learns that Turpin raped Lucy, who then poisoned herself with arsenic. The couple's daughter, Johanna, is now Turpin's ward, and is the object of Turpin's lust. Todd vows revenge, and re-opens his barber shop after Mrs. Lovett returns his straight razors to him. Anthony becomes enamored with Johanna, but is caught by Turpin and driven away by his corrupt associate, Beadle Bamford.\nTodd denounces faux-Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli's hair tonic as a fraudulent mix and humiliates him in a public shaving contest. A few days later, Pirelli arrives at Todd's shop, with his boy assistant Tobias Ragg. Mrs. Lovett keeps Toby occupied while Pirelli identifies himself as Todd's former assistant, Davy Collins, and threatens to reveal Todd's secret unless Todd gives him half his earnings. Todd kills Collins to protect his secret, and hides his body in a trunk.\nAfter receiving advice from Bamford, Turpin, intending marriage to Johanna, visits Todd's shop for grooming. Todd shaves Turpin, preparing to slit his throat; they are interrupted by Anthony, who reveals his plan to elope with Johanna before noticing Turpin. Turpin leaves enraged and Todd vents his rage by killing customers while waiting for another chance to kill Turpin, and Mrs. Lovett bakes the victims into pies. Todd rigs his barber's chair with a pedal-operated mechanism that deposits his victims through a trap door into Mrs. Lovett's basement bake-house. Anthony searches for Johanna, whom Turpin has sent to an insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony.\nThe barbering and pie-making businesses prosper, and Mrs. Lovett takes Toby as her assistant. Mrs. Lovett tells an uninterested Todd of her plans to marry him and move to the seaside. Anthony discovers Johanna's whereabouts and poses as a wig-maker's apprentice to rescue her. Todd has Toby deliver a letter to Turpin, telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her. Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett of his suspicion.\nBamford arrives at the pie shop, informing Mrs. Lovett that neighbors have been complaining of the stink from her chimney. He is distracted by Todd's offer of a free grooming and is murdered by Todd. Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of Toby's suspicions, and the pair search for Toby, whom Mrs. Lovett has locked in the bake-house. He has hidden himself in the sewers after seeing Bamford's body drop into the room from the trap door above, as well as finding a human toe in a pie. Anthony brings Johanna, disguised as a sailor, to the shop, and has her wait there while he leaves to find a coach.\nA beggar woman enters the shop in search of Bamford. She recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin's voice, Todd kills her and sends her through the trap door. As Turpin enters, Todd explains that Johanna had repented and offers a free shave; when Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs him several times before cutting his throat. Upon seeing Johanna, Todd prepares to slit her throat as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. Hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror as a dying Turpin grabs her dress, Todd instead spares Johanna's life.\nTodd discovers that the beggar woman was his wife Lucy, whom he believed to be dead, and that Mrs. Lovett misled him about her death. Todd pretends to forgive her and dances with her before hurling her into the bake-house oven, then cradles his wife's dead body in his arms. Toby climbs from the sewers and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. He leaves the basement as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She turned into the beggar lady on the street."}], "question": "What happened to

in Brooklyn, New York, Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) is the manager of the successful El Caribe nightclub in Brighton Beach that is frequented by Russian black market gangster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov), and owned by Marat Buzhayev, Vadim's uncle and Bobby's boss.\nBobby has distanced himself from his father, NYPD Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg). He uses the maiden name of his mother, Carol Green, as his last name, preferring to remain on the sidelines and enjoy a hedonistic life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez (Eva Mendes) and best friend Louis \"Jumbo\" Falsetti (Danny Hoch).\nWhen Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in the hopes of arresting Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate. The incident strains Bobby's relationship with his father and brother even more, to the point that Bobby and Joseph come to blows.\nThe police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim, who decides to retaliate. The next evening, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant, and his unmarked police cruiser firebombed. Joseph survives the ambush, but is hospitalized for four months. Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim. Bobby resolves to help the police. Without his father's knowledge, Bobby goes undercover inside Vadim's cocaine-smuggling operation with a police listening device hidden in a cigarette lighter, but when the device is discovered, he narrowly escapes being murdered, and the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim.\nBobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody, and their relationship begins to deteriorate. Months later, Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital. The police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location. During a blinding thunderstorm, the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim's men, and during a chaotic car chase, Burt is fatally shot. Bobby passes out in the rain when he sees his father's body.\nThe police take Bobby and Amada back to a hotel near Kennedy Airport. Bobby wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the hotel room. After Joseph tells him that their father died, the grief-stricken Bobby asks how \"they\" found them. At the subsequent funeral, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro, gives him Burt's Korean War medal. Bobby is told that a Russian shipment of cocaine is arriving sometime in the coming week.\nTo avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him. After he is sworn into the NYPD, Bobby learns the true involvement of Jumbo, his friend, and Marat, Vadim's uncle. He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989. During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue. Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out. As the beds are engulfed in flame and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait. Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him.\nNearly a year after the raid on El Caribe, Bobby, now in uniform, graduates from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer. Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting led him to realize that he needs to spend more time with his children. As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictorian address, Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience, but it turns out to be an illusion. Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is the manager of the El Carib nightclub."}], "question": "What is Bobby Green's profession?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brighton Beach."}], "question": "Where is the El Carib nightclub located?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is the NYPD Deputy Chief."}], "question": "What is Bobby Green's father's profession?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The device is hidden in a cigarette lighter."}], "question": "When Bobby goes undercover, where does he hide a police listening device?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He officially joins the police force."}], "question": "What does Bobby do to avenge his father's death?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Amanda leaves Bobby."}], "question": "What does Amanda do when Bobby joins the police force without her consent?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Joseph is in the hospital for four months."}], "question": "How long is Joseph hospitalized after he is wounded in an ambush?", "id": "3a82541bb17890577626925533f6549efe5cf08e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Vadim's operation is smuggling cocaine."}], "question": "What illegial activity is Vadim's operation engaged in?

Now he is planning his most ambitious project yet, backing a railway which will connect the town to the main line and open a fertile valley which he has been secretly buying up.\nSuddenly his past explodes on him. Johan T\u00f8nnesen, his wife's younger brother comes back from America to the town he ran away from 15 years ago. At the time it was thought he had run off with money from the Bernick family business and with the urge to avoid scandal because he was having an affair with an actress. But none of this was true. He left town to take the blame for Bernick, who was the one who had actually been having the affair and was nearly caught with the actress. There was no money to take since at the time the Bernick firm had been almost bankrupt.\nWith T\u00f8nnesen comes his half-sister Lona (whom Ibsen is said to have modelled after Norwegian feminist Aasta Hansteen), who once loved and was loved by Bernick. He rejected her and married his current wife for money so that he could rebuild the family business. In the years since T\u00f8nnesen left, the town has built ever greater rumours of his wickedness, helped by Bernick's studious refusal to give any indication of the truth.\nThis mixture only needs a spark to explode and it gets one when T\u00f8nnesen falls in love with Dina Dorf, a young girl who is the daughter of the actress involved in the scandal of 15 years ago and who now lives as a charity case in the Bernick household. He demands that Bernick tell the girl the truth. Bernick refuses. T\u00f8nnesen says he will go back to the US to clear up his affairs and then come back to town to marry Dina. Bernick sees his chance to get out of his mess. His yard is repairing an American ship, The Indian Girl, which is dangerously unseaworthy. He orders his yard foreman to finish the work by the next day, even if it means sending the ship and its crew to certain death because he wants T\u00f8nnesen to die on board. That way he will be free of any danger in the future. Things do not work out like that. T\u00f8nnesen runs off with Dina on board another ship which is safe, leaving word that he will be back. And Bernick's young son stows away on the Indian Girl, seemingly heading for certain death.\nBernick discovers that his plot has gone disastrously wrong on the night the people of the town have lined up to honour him for his contribution to the city.\nIt is all set up for a tragic conclusion, but suddenly Ibsen pulls back from the brink. The yard foreman gets an attack of conscience and rows out to stop the Indian Girl from heading to sea and death; Bernick's son is brought back safely by his mother; and Bernick addresses the community, tells them most of the truth and gets away with it.

Phoebe then confesses to her sister, Susan, that Brown intends to drop by later that day, and both are certain he means to propose. When he finally does appear, it is not to ask for Phoebe's hand in marriage but to announce his intention to join the fight in Europe against Napoleon. This leaves the girls devastated.\nAct 2\nTen years after the departure of Brown, we find the girls have set up a school in order to pay the rent. Phoebe has not accepted any other suitor and has allowed herself to become an \"Old Maid\" and school mistress. Phoebe, however, longs for her youth, and the return of Captain Brown only deepens her melancholy. \"I am tired of being lady-like,\" she declares. With some encouragement from her maid, Patty, she creates the fictional character of Miss Livvy, a more energetic, flirtatious and naughty version of her younger self, and begins to tease Captain Brown who, captivated by her, persuades her and Susan to accompany him to the ball.\nAct 3\nAt the ball, and Phoebe is still playing the part of Miss Livvy. In this guise, she has captured the eyes of many of the young men and the scorn of ladies. However, Phoebe is now annoyed that Brown seems to prefer this unsubstantial 'young' flirt that she has created to her true personality and qualities. Her actions cause events to come to a head as her act is almost brought to light by the local gossiping girls Fanny Willoughby and Henrietta Turnbull. In a final confrontation with Captain Brown, we discover that he has found his love for Miss Phoebe and not for Miss Livvy, as he insists that \"I have discovered for myself that the schoolmistress in her old maid's cap is the noblest Miss Phoebe of them all.\"\nAct 4\nMiss Livvy still hangs heavy over the sisters: having been created, she is now difficult to dispose of. The local gossips watch for any sign of Miss Livvy and frequently visit the sisters' home. Brown comes to ask for Phoebe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and is turned down without explanation.

He shows, for example, that in large industrial cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, mortality from disease (such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough) was four times that in the surrounding countryside, and mortality from convulsions was ten times as high. The overall death-rate in Manchester and Liverpool was significantly higher than the national average (1 in 32.72, 1 in 31.90 and even 1 in 29.90, compared with 1 in 45 or 46). An interesting example shows the increase in the overall death-rates in the industrial town of Carlisle where before the introduction of mills (1779\u00e2\u0080\u009387), 4,408 out of 10,000 children died before reaching the age of five, and after their introduction the figure rose to 4,738. Before the introduction of mills, 1,006 out of 10,000 adults died before reaching 39 years old, and after their introduction the death rate rose to 1,261 out of 10,000.\nEngels' interpretation proved to be extremely influential with British historians of the Industrial Revolution. He focused on both the workers' wages and their living conditions. He argued that the industrial workers had lower incomes than their pre-industrial peers and they lived in more unhealthy and unpleasant environments. This proved to be a very wide-ranging critique of industrialisation and one that was echoed by many of the Marxist historians who studied the industrial revolution in the 20th century.\nOriginally addressed to a German audience, the book is considered by many to be a classic account of the universal condition of the industrial working class during its time. The eldest son of a successful German textile industrialist, Engels became involved in radical journalism in his youth. Sent to England, what he saw there made him even more radical. About this time he formed his lifelong intellectual partnership with Karl Marx.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That the Industrial Revolution made workers worse off."}],

seen in La Conqu\u0102\u015ete de Plassans, as he takes his orders and becomes the parish priest for the uninterested village of Artauds. The inbred villagers have no interest in religion and Serge is portrayed giving several wildly enthusiastic Masses to his completely empty, near-derelict church. Serge not only seems unperturbed by this state of affairs but actually appears to have positively sought it out especially, for it gives him time to contemplate religious affairs and to fully experience the fervour of his faith. Eventually he has a complete nervous breakdown and collapses into a near-comatose state, whereupon his distant relative, the unconventional doctor Pascal Rougon (the central character of the last novel in the series, 1893's Le Docteur Pascal), places him in the care of the inhabitants of a nearby derelict stately home, Le Paradou.\nThe novel then takes a complete new direction in terms of both tone and style, as Serge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suffering from amnesia and total long-term memory loss, with no idea who or where he is beyond his first name \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is doted upon by Albine, the whimsical, innocent and entirely uneducated girl who has been left to grow up practically alone and wild in the vast, sprawling, overgrown grounds of Le Paradou. The two of them live a life of idyllic bliss with many Biblical parallels, and over the course of a number of months, they fall deeply in love with one another; however, at the moment they consummate their relationship, they are discovered by Serge's monstrous former monseignor and his memory is instantly returned to him. Wracked with guilt at his unwitting sins, Serge is plunged into a deeper religious fervour than ever before, and poor Albine is left bewildered at the loss of her soulmate.

Clara and Theodore's father was a German immigrant who founded his own religion; he came to America just before the American Revolution with the conviction to spread his religion to the indigenous people. When he fails at this task, he believes he has also failed his deity. One night, as he worships in his bare, reclusive temple, he seems to spontaneously combust, after which his health rapidly deteriorates and he dies. His children inherit his property, which is divided equally between them. Theodore marries their childhood friend, Catharine Pleyel, and they have four children.\nSoon, Theodore begins to hear voices and Catharine's brother, Henry Pleyel, begins to hear them, too. Though at first doubtful of the voices that the men claim to hear, Clara also begins to hear a strange voice. The mysterious Carwin appears on the scene, and suggests that the voices may be caused by human mimicry.\nClara is secretly in love with Pleyel, and makes a plan to tell him so; however, her chance is ruined. When she returns home, she finds Carwin hiding in her closet. He admits he had been planning to rape Clara, but believing her to be under the protection of a supernatural force, leaves her.\nThe next morning, Pleyel accuses Clara of having an affair with Carwin. He leaves quickly, without giving Clara enough time to defend herself. She decides to go to see Pleyel, to tell him he is mistaken, but he does not seem to believe her. On her way home, Clara stops to visit her friend Mrs. Baynton, where Clara finds a letter from Carwin waiting for her, which requests an audience with her.\nAt Theodore's house, Clara finds that everyone seems to be asleep, so she continues on to her own home, where she is to meet with Carwin. When she arrives, there are strange noises and lights, and she sees a glimpse of Carwin's face. In her room, she finds a strange letter from Carwin, and Catharine in her bed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 dead. Shocked, she sits in her room until Theodore arrives and threatens Clara. When he hears voices outside, he leaves Clara unharmed. Clara learns that Theodore's children and Louisa Conway have also been killed.\nClara falls ill; later, she is able to read the murderer's testimony. The killer is her brother, Theodore. He claims to have been acting under divine orders. Clara is sure that Carwin is the source of Theodore's madness.\nCarwin reveals to Clara that he is a biloquist. He was the cause of most of the voices, but he claims that he did not tell Theodore to commit the murders. Wieland, having escaped from prison, arrives at Clara's house and tries to kill her. Carwin uses his ability to tell Theodore to stop. He says that Theodore should not have listened to the voices, and Theodore suddenly comes to his senses. He kills himself, full of remorse for what he has done.\nClara refuses to leave her house, until it burns down one day. She then goes to Europe with her uncle, and eventually marries Pleyel. Clara feels she has finally recovered from the tragic events, enough to write them down. As for Carwin, he has become a farmer in the countryside.\nApparently the novel was based on the true story of murders which took place at Tomhannock, New York (a hamlet near Pittstown) in 1781. Mirroring the incidents of the later novel, one James Yates, under the influence of a religious delusion, killed his wife and four children, then attempted to kill his sister, and expressed no remorse for his conduct in court later.\nBrown gave his tragic hero a pedigree related to that of the actual German author Christoph Martin Wieland, who is mentioned obliquely in the text:\nMy ancestor may be considered as the founder of the German Theatre. The modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same family, and, perhaps, surpasses but little, in the fruitfulness of his invention, or the soundness of his taste, the elder Wieland.\nThis and others of Charles Brockden Brown's novels were very influential in the later development of the Gothic genre by such writers as Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and most especially, George Lippard.",

John Meredith is a widower with four young children: Gerald (Jerry), Faith, Una, and Thomas Carlyle (Carl). The children have not been properly brought up since the death of their mother, with only their father (who is easily absorbed by matters of theology) to parent them. The children are considered wild and mischievous by many of the families in the village (who tend only to hear about the Meredith children when they have gotten into some kind of scrape), causing them to question Mr. Meredith's parenting skills and his suitability as a minister.\nFor most of the book, only the Blythes know of the Meredith children's loyalty and kindness. They rescue an orphaned girl, Mary Vance, from starvation, and Una finds a home for her with Mrs. Marshall Elliott. When the children get into trouble, Faith sometimes tries to explain their behavior to the townsfolk, which generally causes an even bigger scandal.\nThe Merediths, Blythes, and Mary Vance often play in a hollow called Rainbow Valley, which becomes a gathering place for the children in the book. Jem Blythe tries to help the Merediths behave better by forming the \"Good-Conduct Club,\" in which the Merediths punish themselves for misdeeds. Their self-imposed punishments lead to Carl becoming very ill with pneumonia after spending hours in a graveyard on a wet night, and to Una fainting in church after fasting all day. When this happens, John Meredith is wracked with guilt over his failings as a father.\nMr. Meredith realizes that he should marry again and give the children a mother, though he has always thought he will never love anyone again as he did his late wife. He is surprised to find that he has fallen in love with Rosemary West, a woman in her late thirties who lives with her sister Ellen, who is ten years older. John proposes marriage to Rosemary, but Ellen forbids Rosemary from accepting, as years earlier they had promised each other never to leave the other following the deaths of their parents. However, Ellen eventually reunites with her childhood beau, Norman Douglas, and asks Rosemary to release her from her promise so she can marry Norman. Rosemary agrees, but now thinks that John Meredith hates her.\nUna overhears her father expressing feelings for Rosemary and goes to ask Rosemary to marry her father despite her misgivings about stepmothers, who Mary Vance has told her are always mean. Rosemary sets her mind at ease and agrees to speak to John Meredith again. They become engaged, and Rosemary and Ellen plan a double wedding in the fall.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Six"}], "question": "How many children do Anne and Gilbert have?",

Baxter family enjoys a comfortable and placid life until the summer when their neighbors, the Parcher family, play host to an out-of-town visitor, Lola Pratt. An aspiring actress, Lola is a \"howling belle of eighteen\" who talks baby-talk \"even at breakfast\" and holds the center of attention wherever she goes. She instantly captivates William with her beauty, her flirtatious manner, and her ever-present prop, a tiny white lap dog, Flopit. William is sure he has found True Love at Last. Like the other youths of his circle, he spends the summer pursuing Lola at picnics, dances and evening parties, inadvertently making himself obnoxious to his family and friends. They, in turn, constantly embarrass and humiliate him as they do not share his exalted opinion of his \"babytalk lady\".\nWilliam steals his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dress-suit and wears it to court Lola in the evenings at the home of the soon-regretful Parcher family. As his lovestruck condition progresses, he writes a bad love poem to \"Milady\", hoards dead flowers Lola has touched, and develops, his family feels, a peculiar interest in beards and child marriages among the 'Hindoos'. To William's constant irritation, his ten-year-old sister Jane and the Baxters' Negro handyman, Genesis, persist in treating him as an equal instead of the serious-minded grown-up he now believes himself to be. His parents mostly smile tolerantly at William\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lovelorn condition, and hope he will survive it to become a responsible, mature adult.\nAfter a summer that William is sure has changed his life forever, Lola leaves town on the train.

Eisenhower, warning about the build-up of the \"military-industrial complex\". This is followed by a summary of John F. Kennedy's years as president, emphasizing the events that, in Stone's thesis, would lead to his assassination. This builds to a reconstruction of the assassination on November 22, 1963. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in New Orleans. Garrison and his team investigate several possible conspirators, including private pilot David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), but are forced to let them go after their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government. Kennedy's suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is killed by Jack Ruby, and Garrison closes the investigation.\nThe investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the Warren Report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, and others involved with Oswald, Ruby, and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon), a male prostitute serving five years in prison for soliciting, who reveals he witnessed Ferrie discussing a coup d'\u0102\u0160tat. As well as briefly meeting Oswald, O'Keefe was romantically involved with a man called \"Clay Bertrand\". Jean Hill (Ellen McElduff), a teacher who says she witnessed shots fired from the grassy knoll, tells the investigators that Secret Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the Warren Commission. Garrison's staff also test the single bullet theory by aiming an empty rifle from the window through which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy. They conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, indicating someone else, or multiple marksmen, were involved.\nGarrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as \"X\" (Donald Sutherland). He suggests a conspiracy at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the CIA, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, Secret Service, FBI, and Kennedy's vice-president & then president Lyndon Baines Johnson as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X explains that the President was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the Vietnam War and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute New Orleans-based international businessman Clay Shaw for his alleged involvement. Upon interrogating Shaw, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President.\nSome of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.\nThe trial of Clay Shaw takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw died of lung cancer in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The assassination of JFK"}], "question": "What major event happens at the beginning of the story?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Garrison"}], "question": "Who is investigating potential people involved in the assassination?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "JFK's suspected assassion, Lee Harvey Oswald, is killed"}], "question": "Why is the investigation closed by Garrison?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In 1966"}], "question": "When is the case reopened?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "There are a lot of inaccuracies contained in it"}], "question": "Why is the Warren Report suspicious?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The grassy knoll"}], "question": "Where does Hill say she witnessed shots come from?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "X"}], "question": "Who does Garrison meet in Washington, D.C.?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because Kennedy wanted to pull the United States out of Vietnam and dismantle the CIA"}], "question": "Why does X believe Kennedy was killed?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In 1969"}], "question": "When does Clay Shaw's trial take place?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He died of lung cancer"}], "question": "How did Shaw die?", "id": "3ea978569f0309158455ca4864a72ed32c5df050"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dwight D.

His father tells his son never to be like him. Stevens then witnesses his father getting killed while robbing a liquor store. He swears that he will never end up the way he has.\nTwenty years later, in Cincinnati, 1991, Stevens is now a police officer. Officer Stevens is recruited by DEA Special Agent Gerald Carver to go undercover on a major sting operation in Los Angeles, claiming that his criminal-like character traits will be more of a benefit undercover than they would serve him as a uniformed policeman. Stevens poses as drug dealer \"John Hull\" in order to infiltrate and work his way up the network of the west coast's largest drug importer, Anton Gallegos and his uncle Hector G\u00fazman, a South American politician. Stevens relocates to a cheap hotel in LA and begins dealing cocaine.\nOne day Stevens is arrested by the devoutly religious L.A.P.D. Narcotics Detective Taft and his corrupt partner Hern\u00e1ndez, when he buys a kilogram in a set-up by Gallegos' low-level street supplier Eddie Dudley. At his arraignment, Stevens discovers that he was sold \"baby laxative\" (mannitol) instead of cocaine and his case is dismissed. Stevens' self-appointed attorney David Jason, who is also a drug trafficker in Gallegos' network, rewards Stevens' silence with more cocaine and introduces Stevens to Felix Barbossa, the underboss to Gallegos. Felix realized that Eddie was working with the LAPD, which results in Felix killing him and enlisting Stevens as Eddie's replacement.\nStevens develops a romance with Betty McCutcheon, the manager of an art dealership which serves as a front to launder Jason's drug money profits. When one of Stevens' dealers is murdered by a rival dealer named Ivy, Stevens kills him and is awarded a partnership in Jason's new business venture; distribution of a synthetic chemical variant of cocaine. It turns out that Felix is working with Detective Hern\u00e1ndez who pressures him into giving him more arrests. Felix immediately gives up Stevens, Jason, and Betty, since he views them as expendable and wants to kill Jason because of his business venture. Carver knows about the upcoming bust, but refuses to interfere forcing Stevens to violate orders and stop it himself. At the deal, Stevens exposes Felix as a police informant, which results in a vengeful Jason killing him.\nGallegos comes to personally meet with Jason and Stevens and informs them that they have inherited Felix's $1.8 million debt. Later that same day, Stevens meets with Carver to tell him about his meeting with Gallegos. Instead Carver pulls a gun on Stevens and orders him to surrender his weapon and get in his car. Angrily Stevens disarms Carver and forces him to reveal what's happening behind the scenes. Carver admits that the State Department is leaving Gallegos and Guzman alone because Guzman may someday be useful as a political asset to them. Stevens' disillusionment reaches its conclusion and he abandons his undercover status vowing to take down Gallegos and Guzman alone.\nStevens and Jason learn that Gallegos is going to kill them anyway, so instead of paying Gallegos, Jason and Stevens cleverly kill him and steal a van storing over a $100 million of Gallegos' cash. Jason and Stevens invite Guzman to a shipyard and offer to return 80% of Gallegos' money if he agrees to invest the remaining 20% in their synthetic cocaine distribution operation. Detective Taft, who has been tailing Stevens, interrupts the deal but is unable to arrest Guzman because of his diplomatic status. Guzman flees the scene before Taft's backup arrives. Taft orders Stevens to surrender, but is shot and wounded by Jason. Stevens reveals to Jason that he is a police officer but Jason ignores this information and cajoles him into joining Jason and abandoning the dying Taft. Jason kills Taft, despite Stevens' pleas to let him go. Stevens then reaffirms himself as a police officer and attempts to arrest Jason, but is forced to kill him when Jason draws his gun.\nAfterwards, Carver leverages Stevens by threatening to charge Betty with several bank fraud violations. In exchange for his favorable testimony of Carver, the DEA, and their sting operation, Stevens can prevent Betty's prosecution. Stevens agrees, but during his testimony to the House Judiciary Subcommittee, he produces a video tape of the incriminating conversation with Guzman at the shipyard, thus potentially ruining Guzman's and Carver\u00b4s career. Later he contemplates what to do with the $11 million of Gallegos' money that he secretly kept.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Not wanting to be like his dad"}], "question": "What's the motivation behind Stevens becoming a police officer?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because of his criminal-like traits he possesses"}], "question": "Why is Stevens selected to go undercover?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he was sold baby laxative instead of cocaine"}], "question": "Why is Steven's arrainment dismissed?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Eddie"}], "question": "Who was working for the LAPD that is killed by Felix?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An art dealership."}], "question": "What serves as a money-laundering front?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Felix"}], "question": "Who gives up Stevens to Detective Hernandez?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That Gallegos and Guzman are being left alone by the State Department"}], "question": "What does Stevens discover after disarming Carver?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a shipyard"}], "question": "Where do Stevens and Jason meet with Guzman to exchange money?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Betty's"}], "question": "Whose prosecution does Stevens prevent?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That he has 11 million of Gallego's money secretly stored away"}], "question": "What secret is Stevens hiding from everyone at the end?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is killed while robbing a liquor store."}], "question": "How does Russell Stevens, Sr. die?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "DEA"}], "question": "What agency recruits Russell Stevens, Jr.?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "John Hull"}], "question": "What name does Officer Stevens use when he goes undercover as a drug dealer?", "id": "3ed7c9dd02debf305c8bcf19afc9860e8d395d61"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mannitol -

Laurania has an African colony which can be reached via the Suez Canal. It has been a republic for many years, and has a well established constitution. Five years previously (stated to be in 1883) the country was split by a civil war, as a result of which General Antonio Molara became President and Dictator. Unrest has arisen because of Molara's refusal to restore parliamentary rule, and the final events of his dictatorship are described in the book.\nThe story opens with a description of the capital and fast-moving political events there. Molara has bowed to popular pressure for elections, but intends to do so on the basis of a grossly amended electoral register. Savrola is seen as the leader of the revolutionaries, deciding what they are to do, and presiding over conflicting factions with differing aims. Despite the unrest, society still proceeds on the surface in a genteel course, with state balls and society events. Molara decides to ask his young and beautiful wife, Lucile, to attempt to seduce Savrola and discover anything she can about his plans. Unfortunately for him, Lucile finds herself attracted to Savrola and her loyalties become confused.\nEvents move from political manoeuvring to street fighting when a rebel army invades Laurania. While Savrola knows about the army and intended invasion, he has poor control over it, so the invasion has started without his knowledge or proper preparations. Both sides scramble for a fight, as Molara finds the country's regular troops refuse to obey his orders. He is obliged to despatch most of the loyal Republican Guard from the capital to oppose the invaders, leaving him with a much reduced force to hold the capital. Fierce street fighting takes place in the capital between the revolutionaries of the Popular Party and the Republican Guard. The revolution culminates in the storming of the Presidential Palace and the death on the steps of his palace of General Molara. The revolutionary allies start to break apart in the face of a threat by the Lauranian navy (which remains loyal to the president), to bombard the city unless Savrola is handed over to them. The council of public safety decides the most expedient position would be to agree to this, but Savrola escapes attempts to arrest him and flees with Lucile. The city is subsequently bombarded when Savrola is not produced, and the last scene is of Savrola watching the destruction from outside the city.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Near the Mediterranean Sea"}], "question": "Where is Laurania?", "id": "3f596a5be9de38b6f63b6c4b92021fe78d403e80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "1883"}], "question": "What year was the civil war in Laurania?", "id": "3f596a5be9de38b6f63b6c4b92021fe78d403e80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Molara"}], "question": "Who is the President of  Laurania?

He aims to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at the Christmas party of her employer, the fictional Nakatomi corporation. McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, an airport limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed terrorists: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower and secures those inside as hostages, except for McClane, who manages to slip away.\nGruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi, and says he intends to teach the corporation a lesson for its greed. Away from the hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault. Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is murdered by Gruber. McClane, who had been secretly watching, accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony. McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). As Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate, Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell arrives and is greeted by Eddie, who is posing as a concierge; he finds nothing strange about the building. As Powell turns to leave, McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car and shoots at him to get his attention. Powell summons the LAPD, who surround the building. McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators.\nJames and Alexander use anti-tank missiles to knock out a SWAT Greyhound armored car, but before they can finish its destruction, they are killed when their building floor is blown up by C-4 that McClane dropped. Holly's coworker Harry Ellis attempts to mediate between Hans and McClane for the return of the detonators. McClane refuses to return them, causing Gruber to murder Ellis. While checking explosives attached to the roof, Gruber is confronted by McClane. Gruber passes himself off as an escaped hostage and is given a gun by McClane. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds that the gun is unloaded. Before McClane can act, Karl, Franco, and Fritz arrive. McClane kills Fritz and Franco, but is forced to flee, leaving the detonators behind.\nFBI agents arrive and take command of the police situation outside, ordering the building's power be shut off. The loss of power\u00e2\u0080\u0094as Gruber had anticipated\u00e2\u0080\u0094disables the vault's final lock. Gruber demands that a helicopter arrive on the roof for transport, and the FBI prepare to double-cross him by sending helicopter gunships to take down the terrorists. However, McClane discovers that Gruber's true intention is to detonate the explosives on the roof, to fake the deaths of his men and himself so they can escape with the bearer bonds, a plan that would also kill the hostages. Meanwhile, Gruber sees a news report by intrusive reporter Richard Thornburg that features McClane's children, and deduces that McClane is Holly's husband. The criminals order the hostages to the roof, but Gruber takes Holly with him to use against McClane. McClane defeats Karl in a fight, kills Uli, and sends the hostages back downstairs before the explosives detonate, destroying the roof and the FBI helicopter.\nTheo goes to the parking garage to retrieve their getaway vehicle but is knocked unconscious by Argyle, who had been trapped in the garage throughout the siege. A weary McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining men, and knocks Kristoff unconscious. McClane surrenders his machine gun to spare Holly, but then distracts Gruber and Eddie by laughing, allowing him to grab a concealed handgun (holding his last two bullets) taped to his back. McClane shoots Gruber in the shoulder and then kills Eddie with his final shot. Gruber crashes through a window, and while he momentarily saves himself by grabbing Holly's watch, McClane removes it and Gruber falls to his death.\nMcClane and Holly are escorted from the building and meet Powell in person. Karl emerges from the building disguised as a hostage and attempts to shoot McClane, but is gunned down by Powell. Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo. Thornburg arrives and attempts to interview McClane, but is punched by Holly. McClane and Holly are then driven away by Argyle.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nakatomi Corporation"}], "question": "What company does Holly work for?

Three weeks after the mission, U.S. President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, during which he praises the capture and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews), and several of his Cabinet and advisers, prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard, including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).\nAfter takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley), who has been a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected. Instead, Korshunov storms the cockpit and prevents the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, and secures Grace and Alice separately from the other hostages. Several F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace.\nUnknown to Korshunov, Marshall, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, has remained hidden in the cargo hold instead of using the pod and begins to observe the loyalists using his military training. Marshall manages to kill some of Korshunov's men and then uses a satellite phone to make contact with his Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), letting his staff know he is alive. Korshunov, believing that only a rogue Secret Service agent is in the cargo hold, contacts Bennett and demands Radek's release, threatening to kill a hostage every half hour. Marshall and military advisors devise a plan to trick Korshunov to take Air Force One to a lower altitude for a mid-air refueling, giving time for the hostages to parachute safely off the plane. As a KC-10 tanker docks with Air Force One, Marshall helps to kill another loyalist and escorts the hostages to the cargo hold, where most parachute away; Marshall insists on staying to rescue his family. Korshunov discovers the deception and forces Air Force One away, causing the fuel to ignite, destroying the tanker; the shock wave disrupts the escape process, and Korshunov is able to stop Marshall, Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd (Paul Guilfoyle), Major Caldwell (William H. Macy), and Gibbs from escaping.\nWith the President and his family under his control, Korshunov forces Marshall to contact Russian President Petrov and arrange for Radek's release. Bennett is urged by Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell) to declare the President incapable under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, so as to override Radek's release, but she refuses. While Korushunov and his men celebrate the news of Radek's release, Marshall breaks his bonds and kills Korshunov's last two henchmen before strangling Korshunov and throwing him off the plane when Korshunov tries to escape himself. Marshall races back to lift his order, and Radek is subsequently killed when he attempts to escape.\nMarshall and Caldwell direct the plane back to friendly airspace, accompanied by the F-15s, only to be quickly tailed by a second batch of Radek loyalists piloting MiG-29s. Marshall is able to evade most of the missile launches; although one F-15 pilot sacrifices himself to intercept a remaining missile, the resulting explosion damages Air Force One's tail, and the 747 start to lose altitude. A standby U.S. Air Force Rescue HC-130 is called to help, sending parajumpers on tether lines to help rescue the survivors. Marshall insists that his family and the injured Shepherd be transferred first. When there is time for only one more transfer, Gibbs reveals himself as the mole, killing Caldwell and the parajumper. Marshall and Gibbs fight for control of the transfer line, and Marshall manages to grab and detach it at the last minute. Air Force One crashes into the Caspian Sea, killing Gibbs. The HC-130 airmen reel Marshall in, who is safely reunited with his family. The HC-130 is subsequently renamed \"Air Force One\" as it flies back to friendly airspace.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To obtain the release of dictator General Ivan Radek"}],

the main character's background. Louis Lambert, the only child of a tanner and his wife, is born in 1797 and begins reading at an early age. In 1811 he meets the real-life Swiss author Madame de Sta\u00ebl (1766\u20131817), who \u2013 struck by his intellect \u2013 pays for him to enroll in the Coll\u00e8ge de Vend\u00f4me. There he meets the narrator, a classmate named \"the Poet\" who later identifies himself in the text as Balzac; they quickly become friends. Shunned by the other students and berated by teachers for not paying attention, the boys bond through discussions of philosophy and mysticism.\nAfter completing an essay entitled Trait\u00e9 de la Volont\u00e9 (\"Treatise on the Will\"), Lambert is horrified when a teacher confiscates it, calls it \"rubbish\", and \u2013 the narrator speculates \u2013 sells it to a local grocer. Soon afterwards, a serious illness forces the narrator to leave the school. In 1815, Lambert graduates at the age of eighteen and lives for three years in Paris. After returning to his uncle's home in Blois, he meets a woman named Pauline de Villenoix and falls passionately in love with her. On the day before their wedding, however, he suffers a mental breakdown and attempts to castrate himself.\nDeclared \"incurable\" by doctors, Lambert is ordered into solitude and rest. Pauline takes him to her family's ch\u00e2teau, where he lives in a near coma. The narrator, ignorant of these events, meets Lambert's uncle by chance, and is given a series of letters. Written by Lambert while in Paris and Blois, they continue his philosophical musings and describe his love for Pauline. The narrator visits his old friend at the Villenoix ch\u00e2teau, where the decrepit Lambert says only: \"The angels are white.\" Pauline shares a series of statements her lover had dictated, and Lambert dies on 25 September 1824 at the age of twenty-eight.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "1797"}], "question": "What year is Louis Lambert born in?", "id": "40d8b1ee377a7a4addca58e31f12d80c77fd8cb8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "none"}], "question": "How many siblings does Louis Lambert have?", "id": "40d8b1ee377a7a4addca58e31f12d80c77fd8cb8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Madame de Stael"}], "question": "What person pays for Louis' college education?", "id": "40d8b1ee377a7a4addca58e31f12d80c77fd8cb8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Balzac"}], "question": "What is the \"poet's\" real name?", "id": "40d8b1ee377a7a4addca58e31f12d80c77fd8cb8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they both were berated by classmates and they had the same interests in topics"}], "question": "Why did Balzac and Louis seem to get along so well?

Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv.\nFifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \"Kappin' Off Suckers\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \"Benny\" Chac\u00f3n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect.\nThe tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, C\u00e9sar, takes over as leader. When C\u00e9sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school.\nThe conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. C\u00e9sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off. C\u00e9sar recovers the finger and it is reattached, with the letters \"R U DUN\" (\"are you done?\") tattooed as a warning.\nA student Garfield has tutored, Rita Mart\u00ednez, a Chicana, faces abuse from both the K.O.S. and Childress, and drops out. The school administration is mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene. After Benny is found dead in the Los Angeles River, apparently of a drug overdose, it is revealed that Garfield took matters into his own hands, killing Benny and severing C\u00e9sar's finger. Garfield lets Ellen leave as she disavows his actions.\nThe K.O.S. plan to murder Garfield. At Garfield's house, the gang forces Garfield into a contest of Russian roulette with C\u00e9sar. The latter's resolve is shaken as Garfield talks about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led. Hesitating at his turn, C\u00e9sar watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head. Driven by his sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, C\u00e9sar insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself .\nOn graduation day, Rita, who completes her studies along with former K.O.S. member Stevie, offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him. The essay incorporates the theme of the Pyrrhic victory and Ellen leaves the school.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Roosevelt Whitney High School"}], "question": "Where does Trevor Garfield teach?

Leia infiltrates Jabba's palace on Tatooine, disguised as a bounty hunter with Chewbacca as her prisoner. Lando is already there, disguised as a guard. Leia releases Han from the carbonite, but she is captured and enslaved. Luke arrives soon afterward but, after a tense standoff with Jabba and a battle with his rancor, is captured. Jabba sentences him, Han and Chewbacca to death, planning to feed them to the Sarlacc, a pit monster. They are taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon, the Sarlacc's nesting ground. Luke, with R2-D2's help, frees himself and battles Jabba's guards. During the chaos, Boba Fett attempts to attack Luke, but Han, temporarily blinded from the carbonite, inadvertently knocks him into the Sarlacc pit. Meanwhile, Leia strangles Jabba to death, and Luke destroys Jabba's sail barge as the group escapes. While the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah, where he finds that Yoda is on his deathbed. Before he dies, Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and that \"there is another\". The ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi confirms that this \"other\" is Luke's twin sister: Leia. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must fight Vader again to defeat the Empire. Obi-Wan also warns Luke to keep his emotions in check, as his anger could lead him to the Dark Side.\nThe Rebels learn that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the direct supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. The strike team, accompanied by Luke and Leia, travels to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. On Endor, Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and he must go and confront him. Luke surrenders to Imperial troops and is taken to Vader. Luke tries to convince Vader to turn from the dark side of the Force, but fails.\nVader takes Luke to the new Death Star to meet the Emperor, who is intent on turning him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Death Star is fully operational and the Rebel fleet will fall into a trap. On Endor, Han's strike team is captured by Imperial forces, but a surprise counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to battle the Imperials. Meanwhile, Lando, piloting the Millennium Falcon, leads the Rebel fleet to the Death Star, only to find that the station's shield is still active and the Imperial fleet is waiting for them. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger and join him. Luke engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and suggests turning her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his father's prosthetic right hand. Upon seeing the remnants of Vader's prosthetic, he sees a parallel between himself and Vader, and fears he will become like Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi as his father had been. On Endor, the strike team defeats the Imperial forces and destroys the shield generator, allowing the Rebel fleet to launch their assault on the Death Star. Simultaneously, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down the Death Star reactor shaft, killing him, but is mortally wounded in the process. He asks Luke to remove his mask, and after a brief talk, he dies peacefully.\nAs the battle between the Imperial and Alliance fleets continues, Lando leads a group of Rebel ships into the Death Star's core and destroys the main reactor. As Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the Falcon flies out of the Death Star as the station explodes. On Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and they kiss. Luke returns to Endor and cremates his father's body on a funeral pyre. As the Rebels celebrate their victory over the Empire, Luke smiles as he sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and the redeemed Anakin watching over them.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Princess Leia disguises herself as a bounty hunter with Chewbacca as her prisoner.

Before the story itself, an extended meditation appears on the nature of human names, and that of Z. Marcas specifically:\nMARCAS!

Ne voyez-vous pas dans la construction du Z une allure contrari\u00e9e? ne figure-t-elle pas le zigzag al\u00e9atoire et fantasque d'une vie tourment\u00e9e?\nMARCAS! say this two-syllabled name again and again; do you not feel as if it had some sinister meaning? Does it not seem to you that its owner must be doomed to martyrdom? Though foreign, savage, the name has a right to be handed down to posterity; it is well constructed, easily pronounced, and has the brevity that beseems a famous name\u00a0... Do you not discern in that letter Z an adverse influence? Does it not prefigure the wayward and fantastic progress of a storm-tossed life?\nThe narrator, Charles, lives with his friend Juste in a large boarding-house populated almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn that he is a copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.\nRecognizing at an early age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his associate had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.\nEventually his politician friend seeks his help for a third time. Marcas is dismissive, but the students convince him to give the process one last chance. After three months, Marcas appears at the boarding house again, sick and exhausted. The politician never visits Marcas, who soon dies. The students are the only mourners at his funeral, and\u00a0\u2013 disheartened by the tragedy\u00a0\u2013 leave France.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a meditation on the nature of human names"}], "question": "Before the story itself begins, what is the reader shown?", "id": "4390a163555dbcd4511aa1edb5df5873d85e6291"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Z.

She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.\nAt the top of a hill, she spies a distant wood, flies to it, and waddles about until she discovers an appropriate nesting place among the foxgloves. However, a charming gentleman with \"black prick ears and sandy-coloured whiskers\" persuades her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima is led to his \"tumble-down shed\" (which is curiously filled with feathers), and makes herself a nest with little ado.\nJemima lays her eggs, and the fox suggests a dinner party to mark the event. He asks her to collect the traditional herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings will be used for an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen and asks her what she is doing and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives.\nWith the help of two fox-hound puppies who are out at walk at the farm, Kep rescues Jemima and the \"foxy-whiskered gentleman\" (Mr. Tod) is chased away and seen again in The Tale of Mr. Tod.

Conan stays the night in a cheap tavern in Zamboula, run by Aram Baksh. As night falls, a black Darfarian cannibal enters Conan's small chamber by means of a trick lock to drag him away to be eaten. All of the Darfarian slaves in the city are cannibals who roam the streets at night. As they only prey on travelers, the people of the city tolerate this and stay locked securely in their homes, while nomads and beggars make sure to spend the night at a comfortable distance from its walls. Even worse, Aram Baksh has made a deal with the cannibals - he provides them \"fresh meat,\" while he profits from the belongings of the ill-fated guests of his inn. This night, however, the unfortunate Darfarian attempts to prey on an armed and wary Conan, and pays with his life. Realizing the trap his room is, Conan takes to the Zamboulan streets where he soon runs into a naked woman chasing through the streets after her deranged lover; Conan rescues them from an attack by the cannibals. She tells him that she tried to secure her lover's unending affection via a love potion which instead made a raving lunatic of him. Suggestively promising Conan \"a reward\" in return for his assistance, they attempt to kill the high priest responsible for the man's madness.\nThe woman is captured in the attempt, and forced - via hypnotism - to dance before the High priest until she dies. Conan, defeating - quite literally - the strangler Baal-pteor at his own game, rescues her and kills the priest. At the point of claiming his payment, however, she reveals that she is really Nafertari, mistress to the satrap of the city, Jungir Khan (the mad man). Taking an antidote to Jungir, she promises Conan position and wealth.\nConan, however, leaves the city and reveals to the reader that he had recognised them almost immediately. He takes his revenge on the tavern owner Aram Baksh by cutting out his tongue and shearing off his beard to render him mute and unrecognizable, and turning him over to the hungry cannibals to devour - one of the most profound displays of Conan's ironic sense of humor - and leaves the city with gold and the magic ring that started the night's intrigues (and which Conan had stolen from the mad Jungir on their first encounter), with the intent to sell it to another interested party.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Conan"}], "question": "Who stays in the cheap tavern that Aram

seventy and eighty years of age, of a large manor, Llanfeare, in Carmarthen, Wales. His niece, Isabel Brodrick, has lived with him for years after the remarriage of her father, and endeared herself to everyone. However, according to his strong traditional beliefs, the estate should be bequeathed to a male heir.\nHis sole male blood relative is his nephew Henry Jones, a London clerk. Henry has, in the past, incurred debts that the squire had paid off, been \"sent away from Oxford\", and generally made a poor impression on his occasional visits to Llanfeare. Nevertheless, Henry is told of his uncle's intention to make him the heir to the estate and is invited to pay a visit. Isabel rejects her uncle's suggestion that she solve his dilemma by marrying Henry, as she cannot stand her cousin. Indefer Jones finds his nephew to be just as detestable as ever. As a result, he overcomes his prejudice and changes his will one final time, in Isabel's favour. Unfortunately, he dies before he can tell anyone.\nFinding the document hidden in a book of sermons by accident, Henry vacillates between keeping silent and revealing its location. He is neither good enough to give up the estate nor evil enough to burn the document, fearing disgrace, a long jail sentence and, not least, eternal damnation. Instead, he comforts himself by reasoning that doing nothing cannot be a crime.\nIndefer Jones had had his last will witnessed by two of his tenants, but since the will cannot be found despite a thorough search of the house, Henry inherits the estate. However, already extant suspicions are only strengthened by his guilty manner. He endures abuse from everyone; his own servants either quit or treat him with disrespect. He takes to spending hours in the library, where the will is hidden.\nThe local newspaper begins to publish accounts of the affair that are insulting and seemingly libelous to Henry. It accuses him of destroying the will and usurping the estate from Isabel, whom everybody knows and respects. The old squire's lawyer, Mr Apjohn, himself suspecting that Henry knows more than he lets on, approaches the new squire about the articles, pressuring the unwilling young man into taking legal action against the editor. Henry finds that this only makes things worse. The prospect of being cross examined in the witness box fills him with dread. He realises the truth would be dragged out of him in court.\nMr Apjohn, by clever questioning, gets a good idea about where the will is. Henry knows that time is running out, but once again procrastinates. Mr Apjohn and Mr Brodrick, Isabel's father, visit Henry at home and find the document, despite Henry's ineffectual efforts to stop them. Because he did not destroy the will, Henry is permitted to return to his job in London with his reputation intact and \u00c2\u01414000, the amount Isabel was bequeathed in the other will.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Isabel Brodrick, his niece "}], "question": "Who does Indefor Jones want to leave his estate to in his will?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His nephew, Henry Jones"}], "question": "Who initially inherits the estate after Indefor Jones passes away?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A document that leaves the estate to Isabel"}], "question": "What secret is Henry trying to keep from being discovered?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is afraid of the consequences he would face"}], "question": "Why doesn't Henry destroy the document he found?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Apjon, Indefors lawyer"}], "question": "Who suspects that Henry is hiding something?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He suspected that Henry had information about Indefors will"}], "question": "Why did Mr. Apjon want Henry to take legal action against the editor of the newspaper?", "id": "485b86c3ffec91e89fbc846985944adc0cf73c80"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Apjon and Mr. Brodrick"}], "question": "Who finds the updated will ?

Later, when Connor and Murphy are celebrating St. Patrick's Day with friends, three Russian mobsters arrive and announce they want to close the pub and take over the land it is built on. A brawl ensues and the next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy, the mobsters are killed in an act of self-defense.\nFBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive what appears to be a \"calling\" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish.\nConnor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from a local underground gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and mob errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe \"Papa Joe\" Yakavetta, is sent in on an independent hit as an unknowing throwaway. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed by Papa Joe, the hit amounting to an attempt to have Rocco killed by the nine Russian mobsters as he was sent in with only a six-shot revolver. As a result, Rocco commits himself to help Connor and Murphy. That night, the MacManus brothers and Rocco hunt down an underboss of the Yakavetta crime family, Vincenzo Lapazzi, and kill him.\nConcerned he may be a target, Papa Joe contacts a hitman, Il Duce, to deal with them. After killing a criminal that Rocco had a personal hatred for, the three men are ambushed by Il Duce. Although they manage to chase Il Duce away, the three men suffer serious wounds, the most serious being the loss of Rocco's finger. The three return to a safehouse where they cauterize each other's wounds.\nHours later as the police conduct an investigation at the crime scene, the investigation seems futile since the brothers covered their tracks by spraying any blood left behind with ammonia. However, Smecker happens upon the part of the finger lost by Rocco and decides to do an independent investigation to see who was behind the gun battle. Smecker is able to track the evidence down to Rocco and his two allies. This leaves Smecker in a difficult scenario, and struggles with the choice of whether to prosecute the three men, or join them in their cause, as Smecker had become sympathetic towards the brothers' actions. After getting drunk at a gay bar and subsequently getting advice from a reluctant priest, Smecker decides to help the trio.\nLater, the brothers and Rocco inform Smecker that they plan to infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family, but Smecker learns they are walking into a trap. The brothers are captured, and Rocco is shot and killed by Papa Joe, but the brothers are able to free themselves. As Papa Joe leaves his house, Smecker arrives in drag and kills a number of soldiers before being knocked unconscious by Il Duce. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce enters the room and prepares to open fire. However, he instead finishes the prayer - revealing he is the brothers' father and deciding to join his two sons in their mission.\nThree months later, Papa Joe is sent to trial for a third time. However, the reporters on-scene anticipate his acquittal. The brothers and Il Duce, aided by Smecker, infiltrate the trial after sliding their weapons over the metal detector. Unmasked, they make a speech stating that they intend to eradicate evil wherever they find it before reciting their family prayer and killing Papa Joe. The media dubs the three as \"the Saints\", and the movie ends with various candid interviews with the public, reflecting on the question \"Are the Saints ultimately good... or evil?\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Two of the Russian mobsters who started a fight at the pub.

They are all veterans of the merchant navy. The main character, Marlow, tells the story of his first voyage to the East as second mate on board the Judea. The story is set twenty-two years earlier, when Marlow was 20. With two years of experience, most recently as third mate aboard a crack clipper, Marlow receives a billet as second mate on the barque Judea. The skipper is Captain John Beard, a man of about 60. This is Beard's first command. The Judea is an old boat, belonging to a man \"Wilmer, Wilcox or something similar\", suffering from age and disuse in Shadewell basin. The 400-ton ship is commissioned to take 600 tons of coal from England to Thailand. The trip should take approximately 150 days. The ship leaves London loaded with sand ballast and heads north to the Senn river to pick up the cargo of coal. On her way, the Judea suffers from her ballast shifting aside and the crew go below to put things right again. The trip takes 16 days because of inclement weather, and the battered ship must use a tug boat to get into port. The Judea waits a month on the Tyne to be loaded with coal. The night before she ships out she is hit by a steamer, the Miranda or the Melissa. The damage takes another three weeks to repair. Three months after leaving London, the Judea ships off for Bangkok.\nThe Judea travels through the North Sea and Britain. 300 miles west of the Lizard a winter storm, 'the famous winter gale of twenty-two years ago', hits. The storm \"guts\" the Judea; she is stripped of her stanchions, ventilators, bulwarks, cabin-door, and deck house. The oakum is stripped from her bottom seams and the men are forced to work at the pumps \"watch and watch\" to keep the ship afloat. After weathering the storm they must fight their way against the wind back to Falmouth to be refitted. Despite three attempts to leave, the Judea ultimately remains in Falmouth for more than six months until she is finally overhauled, recaulked, and refitted with a new copper hull. During the laborious overhaul, the cargo is wetted, knocked about, and reloaded multiple times. The rats abandon the reshipped barque and a new crew is brought in from Liverpool (because no sailor will sail on a ship abandoned by rats).\nThe Judea ships out to Bangkok, running at times 8 knots, but mostly averaging 3 miles per hour. Near the coast of Western Australia, the cargo spontaneously combusts. The crew attempts to smother the fire, but the hull cannot be made airtight. Then they attempt to flood the fire with water, but they cannot fill the hull. One hundred and ninety miles out from Java Head, the gases in the hull explode and blow up the deck; Marlow is hurled into the air and falls on the burning debris of the deck. The Judea hails a passing steamer, the Sommerville, which agrees to tow the wounded ship to Anjer or Batavia. Captain Beard intends to scuttle the Judea there to put out the fire, and then resurface her and resume the voyage to Bangkok. However, the speed of the Sommerville fans the smoldering fire into flames. The crew of the Judea is forced to send the steamer on without them while they attempt to save possibly most of the ship's gear for the underwriters. The gear is loaded into three small boats, which head due north towards Java. Before the crew leaves the Judea, they enjoy a last meal on deck. Marlow becomes skipper of the smallest of the ship's three boats. All the boats make it safely into a Java port, where they book passage on the steamer Celestial, which is on her return trip to England.\nThe story is loosely based upon reality. One of Conrad's pen-pals, or friends, discovered the secret of the port at which the boats called: the port was Muntok. Conrad became angry with him, calling Muntok 'a beastly hole'. The boats of the real ship reached the safety only after several hours, Marlow was a bit younger than Conrad etc.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "42 years old"}], "question": "How old is Marlow as he is telling this story?", "id": "4a130666c65fb9435977c7b28ace9f922b224567"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "This was his first time"}], "question": "According to the story, how many times had Captain Beard commanded a ship?", "id": "4a130666c65fb9435977c7b28ace9f922b224567"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had two years of experience"}], "question": "How many years of experience did Marlow have when he took his first voyage to the East?", "id": "4a130666c65fb9435977c7b28ace9f922b224567"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The ship was name the Judea"}], "question": "What was the name of the ship that Marlow was on?

Although the story happens in the \u201cLensman\u201d universe he is not a Lensman. Instead he is a nuclear engineer with an amazingly mathematical mind. He is a high level genius and a lightning calculator. In his universe there is something we have apparently don't have in ours, self-sustaining vortices of atomic energy. These are like a small piece of the heart of a star. A churning vortex of heat and light that slowly grows while consuming whatever it is in contact with. In theory they can be blown out by a precise amount of explosives, placed at an exact spot in the vortex, at exactly the right time. The problem is, it takes the best computers available hours to calculate the factors needed, and only seconds are available to get the correct amount of explosives on target. Also, if you try to blow one out, but don't get the factors right, all you do is split the vortex into many separate vortices and scatter them far and wide, and soon each is as dangerous as the original. Although Storm Cloud, being a nuclear engineer and lightning calculator, should be able to calculate the factors and extinguish a vortex, in practice he can't. It would be very dangerous and Storm has a wife and kids, and putting himself in that kind of danger ties his mind up with worry so much that he just can't do it.\nThen things change in a major way. Cloud's family is tragically killed when a misguided attempt blow out a vortex lands one of the fragments right on his house. Devastated by the loss of his family, Cloud takes a leave of absence from the Radiation Lab where he works studying the vortices. As he drives he is struck with an idea for \"blowing out\" a vortex. It is slightly technical (Smith explains it so it can be easily followed), but the general idea is that Cloud's brain works so fast that he can calculate exactly where the center of the vortex will be at a moment in time and how big an explosive is needed, then hit it with a bomb that is set at the exact strength to actually extinguish the vortex instead of blowing it apart and making more vortices.\nThis works, and it makes Cloud a very popular guy. As it continues the book tells of Cloud's new job as the universe's one and only vortex blaster. This job takes him from planet to planet where he blows out vortices, matches wits against drug dealers and gangsters, meets new life forms, and acquires a crew for his small scout ship. His adventures are many and varied, and the lifeforms he meets are strange and interesting.\nEventually the Galactic Patrol decides that having only one \u201cVortex Blaster\u201d is inviting disaster. If something happens to Storm Cloud, they are at the mercy of the loose vortices again. As a result, Dr. Cloud is called back to Tellus (what the Earth is called in Smith's stories) and given a new ship. A specially modified, light cruiser (called Vortex Blaster II ) outfitted to carry everything that is needed to extinguish vortices. He is also introduced to Joan Janowick, the leading computer expert of Civilization. Her job is to build a computer that can reproduce whatever it was that Storm Cloud does and blow out vortices like he can. Working closely with Joan on a series of ever faster computers, his eyes soon turn more and more toward his pretty, super smart, and self-taught psychic co-worker and his heart begins to heal. As they fall in love, he bonds psionically with Joan, a pivotal point in the novel, as this leads him to find and communicate with the pure-energy alien beings that have been unknowingly causing the problems. The original vortices are found to be the incubators that an alien species uses to breed and raise its young! That makes the Vortex Blaster an inadvertent murderer of children, a fact that does cause him anguish. In the end an agreement is reached, the aliens close down the \"incubators\" and move their offspring to vortices the Patrol has helped set up on uninhabited planets. As the story ends, \"Storm\" Cloud, the Vortex Blaster, is out of a job.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Storm"}], "question": "What is Neal's nickname?", "id":

public identification with the work: \"Bliss is Bliss and Wells is Wells. And Bliss can write all sorts of things that Wells could not do.\"\nAs he was to do in The Research Magnificent, Wells creates a literary character (Reginald Bliss) who is making a book out of the literary remains of an author who has recently died (George Boon, a popular author of books and plays). Bliss attributes Boon's death to depression on account of the war. Bliss expresses disappointment that among Boon's papers (kept in \"barrels in the attic\") he has found \"nothing but fragments\" and \"a curious abundance of queer little drawings,\" many of which are reproduced'.\nThe principal text by Boon that he presents is titled The Mind of the Race, which is \"the singularly vivid and detailed and happily quite imaginary account of the murder of that eminent litt\u0102\u0160rateur, Dr. Tomlinson Keyhole.\" Bliss also recounts conversations about the themes of this work which he has had with Boon and with Edwin Dodd, \"a leading member of the Rationalist Press Association, a militant agnostic,\" and later with an author named Wilkins.\nThe principal philosophical theme engaged in Boon is whether such a thing as \"the Mind of Humanity\" can be said to exist, or whether, as Dodd believes, such a notion is \"mysticism.\"\nIn the unfinished work Boon was planning, a character named Hallery is \"fanatically obsessed by this idea of the Mind of the Race,\" as indeed Wells was himself. He is imagined lecturing unsuccessfully on the subject at a conference on the subject at a seaside villa that Henry James attends. Chapter 4 of Boon is largely a frontal assault on Henry James's late manner, and contains long pastiches of his style. James's belief that a novel should have unity is vigorously attacked, as are his characters (\"eviscerated people he has invented\" who \"never make lusty love, never go to angry war, never shout at an election or perspire at poker,\" but only \"nose out suspicions, hint by hint, link by link\"). Chapter 5 mocks other writers, especially George Bernard Shaw, and includes an outline of a paper on \"The Natural History of Greatness, with especial reference to Literary Reputations\" that shows that some of Wells's critical notions were far ahead of his time. Wells's stand-in Hallery argues for an expansion of the concept of literature that anticipates future critical developments. Chapter 6 analyses the resistance Hallery's quasi-religious concept of the institution of literature inspires, even in Hallery himself. Chapter 7 criticises the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche and lambastes Houston Stewart Chamberlain's pro-German work The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century.\nBoon concludes with two humorous symbolic tales entitled \"The Wild Asses of the Devil\" and \"The Last Trump.\" The latter tale engages theological themes that Wells would soon be developing in a serious vein in God the Invisible King (1917).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Natural History of Greatness"}], "question": "In chapter 5 the outline of the paper included was on what?", "id":

princess named Petulant, an eight-year-old girl who cannot be pleased at any cost. Her father, the King, gathers his council together to help find a toy for the Princess that will surpass all others. The Prime Minister volunteers his son Martin to find the princess a special toy. Martin talks with Princess Petulant and promises to return in four weeks with an amazing toy.\nAt the beginning of Martin\u2019s journey he encounters Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter who knows everything. Martin hopes that Bobolink will help him to find his way to The Wonderful Toymaker. However, Bobolink is annoyed about having to provide information about everything to everyone, and is initially reluctant to assist Martin. Martin\u2019s lack of flattery towards him serves as a refreshing change, and Bobolink soon becomes quite eager to help him. Bobolink tells Martin that his next step is to reach the pine dwarfs, warning him to avoid conversation with the creatures or he will be stuck in the country of conversation forever. Martin almost makes it through the country of conversation without a single word, but he becomes distracted and engages in conversation with a fish. Martin\u2019s error forces him to \"become conversation,\" and suddenly he is trapped with no way out. The princess continues to wait patiently but she eventually becomes very upset that Martin has not returned with her toy. The council becomes worried, and contemplates where Martin could possibly be. The Princess, alone and sobbing, is confronted by a pine dwarf who promises to bring her to the waterfall and show her the way to Martin. The Princess stuffs her ears with cotton and begins her journey.\nPrincess Petulant finally makes it to Martin without speaking a single word, and they are both able to escape. The two run as fast as they can to the toyshop. The Toymaker, so pleased to see them, wishes that they stay and play with him forever. Martin and Princess Petulant play with the best toys they have ever seen, finally satisfying the Princess\u2019 desire for a new toy. Martin and Princess Petulant tell the Toymaker that they are unable to stay and although he is sad, he assists them in their journey home. Upon their return they tell the entire story to a Royal Historian who records it all in the very book in which this story is contained.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is eight years old."}], "question": "How old is Petulant?", "id": "4a92bf273183297c7b9e2a39e4ba9044d0eb1e33"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Martin does not flatter him."}], "question": "Why is Bobolink eventually eager to help Martin?", "id": "4a92bf273183297c7b9e2a39e4ba9044d0eb1e33"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bobolink warns Martin to avoid conversation with the dwarfs."}], "question": "What does Bobolink warn Martin of when dealing with the pine dwarfs?", "id": "4a92bf273183297c7b9e2a39e4ba9044d0eb1e33"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Martin says he will be gone 4 weeks."}], "question": "How long does Martin say he will be gone?", "id": "4a92bf273183297c7b9e2a39e4ba9044d0eb1e33"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He talks with a fish."}], "question": "What does Martin converse with that causes him to become trapped?", "id": "4a92bf273183297c7b9e2a39e4ba9044d0eb1e33"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She puts cotton in her ears.

At first, the captain of the barge objects to his demand to travel without paying for the passage, and Conan threatens him and the crew with his drawn sword. Eventually the captain agrees to let Conan stay on board, since \"It would be useful to have a fighting man on the voyage\" and eventually Conan and the captain, named Tito, become quite friendly. The captain is soon informed that Conan is fleeing the civil authorities of Argos due to a court dispute in which Conan refused to betray the whereabouts of a casual friend to a fascistic magistrate (although no actual political reference is hinted in Howard's story) and instead drew his sword and killed the magistrate - whereupon he had to swiftly flee. It is emphasized that at this moment Conan was a complete land-lubber, with no previous experience or knowledge of the sea.\nUpon reaching the pirate-infested waters of Kush, their trade ship is attacked by the infamous reavers led by B\u00ealit, the Queen of the Black Coast. B\u00ealit and her ebony-skinned warriors slaughter the crew of the Argus, who are no match for the ferocious pirates. Conan tries to rally the crew after the captain was killed, and when the fight becomes clearly hopeless he manages to jump aboard the pirate ship and sell his life dearly. Conan kills many of the pirates, fully expecting to be overwhelmed and killed - whereupon B\u00ealit suddenly orders her crew to step back and spare Conan, being impressed with the Cimmerian's courage and ferocity (and being sexually attracted to him, as she immediately and forthrightly declares). B\u00ealit offers Conan the chance to sail with her, be her chosen mate, and help lead her fierce warriors. Oddly smitten by this fiery woman, Conan agrees and, for a time, they raid the Black Coast together brutally pillaging coastal towns and instilling fear into the superstitious natives.\nSoon, the Hyborian legends begin that the she-devil of the sea, B\u00ealit, has found a mate, Conan, an iron man whose wrath is that of a wounded lion. Survivors of butchered Stygian ships curse the name of B\u00ealit and her Cimmerian warrior with fierce blue eyes.\nSailing up a nameless river, B\u00ealit and Conan encounter ancient ruins in which is found a lost treasure, a winged monstrosity and skulking hyenas that were once men. Despite the bizarre murders of their crew and the various horrors lurking in the jungle, B\u00ealit and Conan still find time for a thorough theological discussion, comparing Conan's grim god Crom with B\u00ealit's more ambiguous Semite deities - all of which they discuss in between continuing their sexual romance which is alluded to by Howard as having sadomasochistic undertones. In a moment of passion, B\u00ealit promises that even death could not keep her from Conan's side, a promise which she must keep far sooner than she expects.\nDespite her intense love for Conan, B\u00ealit is soon captivated by a cursed jeweled necklace found among the lost treasure which seemingly instills the wearer with a mix of madness and monomania. In such a twisted mental state, B\u00ealit issues faulty orders. Given the constant bizarre dangers and her own madness, her crew is soon decimated and B\u00ealit herself is hanged by the winged monster. Driven to rage and now alone, Conan confronts her supernatural murderer. He is on the verge of being slain when the spirit of B\u00ealit intervenes. Conan slays the winged horror and leaves the ruins in B\u00ealit's ship with her corpse.\nThe story closes with Conan giving B\u00ealit a Viking funeral - setting on fire the ship, with her surrounded by all her treasures - and reflecting upon his loss.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Captain let Conan stay because it will be useful to have a fighting man on the voyage."}], "question": "Why did captain agrees to let Conan stay on board?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tito"}], "question": "What was the Captain name?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The trade ship was attacked  by the infamous raevers."}], "question": "What happen  when the trade  ship got to water of Kush?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit  the Queen  of Black Coast"}], "question": "Who is the leader of the raevers?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit spare Conan life because Belit was impresses with his courage and ferocity."}], "question": "Why did belit spare Conan life?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit asked Conan to sail with her and be her mate."}], "question": "What did Belit asked Conan to do?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit and Conan encounter ancient run with treasure."}], "question": "What did Belit and Conan encounter at nameless river?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A cursed jeweled necklace captivated Belit"}], "question": "What captivated Belit?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit was hanged by the winged monster"}], "question": "How did Belit died?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Conan slays the winged horror"}], "question": "What did Conan did to the winged horror?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Captian believes it will be useful to have a fighting man on board."}], "question": "Why does the Captian Tito allow Conan to board the Argus without paying?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit"}], "question": "What is the name of the leader of the reavers who attack the Argos when they first arrive in Kush?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They find lost treasure, a winged monstrocity and hyenas which were once men"}], "question": "What do Belit and Conan find in the ancient ruins?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A cursed necklace"}], "question": "What is the cause of Belit's madness?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The spirit of Belit"}], "question": "Who saves Conan from the winged monster?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because Conan killed the Magistrate"}], "question": "Why is Conan fleeing Argos at the beginning of the story?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "blue"}], "question": "What color are Conan's eyes?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Kush"}], "question": "When Conan boards the Argus what is the barge's destination?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit's ship"}], "question": "To what does Conan set fire to at the end of the story?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Argus."}], "question": "What is the name of the barge Conan demands passage aboard?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tito."}], "question": "What is the name of the male captain that Conan befriends?", "id": "4d64bda641788de51424d99f5f79393767abfac7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Belit.

Also in residence are Mrs. Bretton's son, John Graham Bretton (whom the family calls Graham), and a young visitor, Paulina Home (who is called Polly). Polly is a peculiar little girl who soon develops a deep devotion to Graham, who showers her with attention. But Polly's visit is cut short when her father arrives to take her away.\nFor reasons that are not stated, Lucy leaves Mrs. Bretton's home a few weeks after the Polly's departure. Some years pass, during which an unspecified family tragedy leaves Lucy without family, home, or means. After some initial hesitation, she is hired as a caregiver by Miss Marchmont, a rheumatic crippled woman. Lucy is soon accustomed to her work and has begun to feel content with her quiet lifestyle.\nDuring an evening of dramatic weather changes, Miss Marchmont regains all her energy and feels young again. She shares with Lucy her sad love story of 30 years previously, and concludes that she should treat Lucy better and be a better person. She believes that death will reunite her with her dead lover. The next morning, Lucy finds Miss Marchmont dead.\nLucy then leaves the English countryside and goes to London. At the age of 23, she boards a ship for Labassecour despite knowing very little French. She travels to the city of Villette, where she finds employment as a bonne (nanny) at Mme. Beck's boarding school for girls. (This school is seen as being based upon the H\u00e9gers' Brussels pensionnat). After a time, she is hired to teach English at the school, in addition to having to mind Mme. Beck's three children. She thrives despite Mme. Beck's constant surveillance of the staff and students.\n\"Dr. John,\" a handsome English doctor, frequently visits the school because of his love for the coquette Ginevra Fanshawe. In one of Villette's famous plot twists, \"Dr. John\" is later revealed to be John Graham Bretton, a fact that Lucy has known but has deliberately concealed from the reader. After Dr. John (i.e., Graham) discovers Ginevra's unworthiness, he turns his attention to Lucy, and they become close friends. She values this friendship highly despite her usual emotional reserve.\nWe meet Polly (Paulina Home) again at this point; her father has inherited the title \"de Bassompierre\" and is now a Count. Thus her name is now Paulina Home de Bassompierre. Polly and Graham soon discover that they knew each other in the past and renew their friendship. They fall in love and eventually marry.\nLucy becomes progressively closer to a colleague, the irascible, autocratic, and male chauvinist professor, M. Paul Emanuel, a relative of Mme. Beck. Lucy and Paul eventually fall in love.\nHowever, a group of conspiring antagonists, including Mme. Beck, the priest P\u00e8re Silas, and the relatives of M. Paul's long-dead fianc\u00e9e, work to keep the two apart. They finally succeed in forcing M. Paul's departure for the West Indies to oversee a plantation there. He nonetheless declares his love for Lucy before his departure and arranges for her to live independently as the headmistress of her own day school, which she later expands into a pensionnat (boarding school).\nDuring the course of the novel, Lucy has three encounters with the figure of a nun \u2014 which may be the ghost of a nun who was buried alive on the school's grounds as punishment for breaking her vow of chastity. In a highly symbolic scene near the end of the novel, she discovers the \"nun's\" habit in her bed and destroys it. She later finds out that it was a disguise worn by Ginevra's amour, Alfred de Hamal. The episodes with the nun no doubt contributed substantially to the novel's reputation as a gothic novel.\nVillette's final pages are ambiguous. Although Lucy says that she wants to leave the reader free to imagine a happy ending, she hints strongly that M. Paul's ship was destroyed by a storm during his return journey from the West Indies. She says that, \"M. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were the three happiest years of my life.\" This passage suggests that he was drowned by the \"destroying angel of tempest.\"\nBront\u00eb described the ambiguity of the ending as a \"little puzzle.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Polly's father"}], "question": "Who takes Polly away from Mrs. Bretton's home?", "id": "4e6e052732e90a9c127f6502feddee1a17301c14"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The weather"}], "question": "What causes Miss Marchmont's sudden youthful energy?", "id": "4e6e052732e90a9c127f6502feddee1a17301c14"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The headmistress of her own school"}], "question": "Before he leaves France, what does M.

Bucky learns that Elizabeth was an aspiring actress who appeared in a pornographic film. Through his investigation, Bucky learns that Elizabeth liked to hang out with lesbians. He goes to a lesbian nightclub and meets Madeleine Linscott, who looks very much like Elizabeth. Madeleine, who comes from a prominent family, tells Bucky that she was 'very close' with Elizabeth but asks him to keep her name out of the papers. In exchange for his silence, she promises him sexual favors. Continuing his relationship with Madeleine, Bucky meets her wealthy parents, Emmett and Ramona.\nBucky's partner, Lee, also becomes obsessed with Elizabeth's murder. Lee's obsession leads him to become erratic and abusive towards his long-time girlfriend Kay Lake, who is also one of Bucky's close friends. After Lee and Bucky have a nasty argument about a previous case, Bucky goes to Lee and Kay's to apologize, only to learn from Kay that Lee was responding to a tip about a recently released convict, Bobby DeWitt. Bucky goes to the location and gets into an altercation with DeWitt in the atrium of the building. DeWitt is gunned down by Lee, standing on the stairs across the atrium. Bucky sees a man sneak up behind Lee, wrapping a rope around Lee's neck. Lee fights back while Bucky, paralyzed with shock, watches from across the atrium as a second shadowy figure steps out and slits Lee's throat. Lee and the man holding the rope fall over the railing to their deaths several floors below. It is then that Bucky is helped by Millard and Morrie Friedman; a friend of Lee's whom Bucky saw with Lee at the New Year's party in 1946.\nDealing with the grief of losing Lee propels Bucky and Kay into a sexual encounter. The next morning, Bucky finds money from a bank robbery hidden in Lee / Kay's bathroom. Kay reveals that she had been DeWitt's girlfriend, that DeWitt had mistreated her, and that DeWitt had done the bank robbery; stealing a large sum of money from one of Benny \"Bugsy\" Siegel's nightclubs. Lee had rescued Kay and stolen DeWitt's bank robbery money. Lee needed to kill DeWitt now that he was out of prison; leading to the encounter that resulted in Lee's death. Bucky leaves, furious with Lee and Kay for their actions and lies. He returns to Madeleine's family mansion and continues his intense relationship with her. Kay is furious when she discovers the relationship, especially with the fact that Madeleine bears a striking resemblance to the same girl Lee obsessed over before he was killed, and leaves the scene.\nWatching an old movie one night, Bucky notices that a bedroom scene matches the set in Elizabeth's pornographic film. The credits at the end of the film includes the statement \"Special Thanks to Emmett Linscott\", Madeleine's father. Bucky's search for answers leads him to an incomplete housing project that Madeleine's father had started just below the Hollywoodland sign. In one of the empty houses, Bucky recognizes the set that was used to film Elizabeth's pornographic movie. In a barn on the property, Bucky finds where Elizabeth was killed and her body butchered, as well as a drawing of a man with a Glasgow smile. The drawing resembles a painting in Madeleine's family home and matches the disfiguring smile carved into Elizabeth's face during her murder.\nBucky confronts Madeleine and her father in their home, accusing them of murdering Elizabeth. Madeleine's mother Ramona reveals that she was the one to kill Elizabeth, who looked so much like Madeleine. She confesses first that Madeleine was not fathered by Emmett but rather by his best friend, George. She further reveals that George had been on set when Elizabeth's pornographic film was made, becoming infatuated with her. Finally, she felt that Elizabeth looked too much like Madeleine, was bothered that George was going to have sex with someone who looked like his own daughter, and decided to kill Elizabeth first. Upon finishing her confession, Ramona kills herself.\nA few days later, remembering something Lee had said during the investigation, Bucky visits Madeleine's sister Martha with some questions. He learns that Lee knew about the lesbian relationship between Madeleine and Elizabeth and was blackmailing Madeleine's father to keep it secret. Bucky finds Madeleine at a seedy motel, and she admits to being the shadowy figure who slit Lee's throat. Although she insists that Bucky wants to have sex with her rather than kill her, he tells her she is wrong and shoots her dead. Bucky later goes to Kay's house. Kay tells him to come in and closes the door as the film ends.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lesbians"}], "question": "Who did Elizabeth Short like to hang out with?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\"The Black Dahlia\""}], "question": "What was Elizabeth Short later known as?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Detectives Dwight \"Bucky\" Bleichart and Lee Blanchard"}], "question": "Who was investigating Elizabeth's murder?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lee"}], "question": "Who guns down Dewitt?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Madeleine"}], "question": "Who does \"Bucky start a relationship with?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dewitt"}], "question": "Who did Kay used to date before Lee?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lee"}], "question": "Which of the two detectives died?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Madeleine's mother Ramona"}], "question": "Who really killed Elizabeth?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elizabeth looked too much like Madeleine."}], "question": "Why did Ramona kill Elizabeth?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Madeleine"}], "question": "Who does Bucky kill?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dwight Bleichert"}], "question": "What is Bucky's real name?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elizabeth Short."}], "question": "What is The Black Delahia's real name?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Madeleine Linscott"}], "question": "Who does Bucky meet at the lesbian nightclub?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sexual favors"}], "question": "What does Madeleine promise Bucky in order to keep her name out of the papers?", "id": "5133a6a7c3d5ca16a030e82339b149d38dd0bbc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bobby DeWitt, a recently released convict"}], "question": "Who was Lee supposed to be meeting when he was killed?

Shrek tells them that he will go ask Farquaad to send them back. He brings along a talking Donkey who is the only fairytale creature who knows the way to Duloc.\nMeanwhile, Farquaad tortures the Gingerbread Man into giving the location of the remaining fairytale creatures until his guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king. To be a king he must marry a princess and is given three options, from which he chooses Princess Fiona, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by lava and a dragon. The Mirror tries to mention \"the little thing that happens at night\" but is unsuccessful.\nShrek and Donkey arrive at Farquaad's palace in Duloc, where they end up in a tournament. The winner gets the \"privilege\" of rescuing Fiona so that Farquaad may marry her. Shrek and Donkey easily defeat the other knights in wrestling-match fashion, and Farquaad accepts his offer to move the fairytale creatures from his swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle and split up to find Fiona. Donkey encounters the dragon and sweet-talks the beast before learning that it is female. Dragon takes a liking to him and carries him to her chambers. Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism. As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey, caught in Dragon's tender clutches, and forces her to chase them out of the castle. At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre.\nAs the three journey to Duloc, Fiona urges the two to camp out for the night while she sleeps in a cave. Shrek and Donkey stargaze while Shrek tells stories about great ogres and says that he will build a wall around his swamp when he returns. When Donkey persistently asks why, he says that everyone judges him before knowing him; therefore, he feels he is better off alone, despite Donkey's admission that he did not immediately judge him when they met.\nAlong the way, Shrek and Fiona find they have more in common and fall in love. The trio is almost at Duloc, and that night Fiona shelters in a windmill. When Donkey hears strange noises coming from it, he finds Fiona turned into an ogre. She explains her childhood curse and transforms each night, which is why she was locked away, and that only her true love's kiss will return her to her \"love's true form\". Shrek, about to confess his feelings for Fiona with a sunflower, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation to an \"ugly beast\" as disgust with him. Fiona makes Donkey promise not to tell Shrek, vowing to do it herself. The next morning, Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to Fiona. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt Shrek angrily leaves his friendship with Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, remembering what Fiona \"said\" about him.\nDespite his privacy, Shrek is devastated and misses Fiona. Furious at Shrek, Donkey comes to the swamp where Shrek says he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation. Donkey keeps his promise to Fiona and tells Shrek that she was talking about someone else. He accepts Shrek's apology and tells him that Fiona will be getting married soon, urging Shrek into action to gain Fiona's love. They travel to Duloc quickly, thanks to Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.\nShrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona. He tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre in front of everyone in the church, causing a surprised Shrek to fully understand what he overheard. Outraged by Fiona, Farquaad orders Shrek killed and Fiona detained. Shrek whistles for Dragon who bursts in along with Donkey and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss; Fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised that she is still an ogre, as she thought she would become beautiful, to which Shrek replies that she is beautiful. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon while the rest celebrate by singing \"I'm a Believer\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lord Farquaad"}], "question": "Who orders all of the fairytale members to the swamp?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Donkey"}], "question": "Who knows how to get to Duloc?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Gingerbread Man"}], "question": "Who is Farquaad torturing?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The magic mirror"}], "question": "Who tells Lord Farquaad that he is not a king?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He'll remove everyone from the swap if Shrek rescues Fiona"}], "question": "What is the deal that Lord Farquaad makes with Shrek?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Dragon"}], "question": "Who carries Donkey into her chambers?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He will build a wall"}], "question": "What does Shrek plan to do once he's back in the swamp?", "id": "51dee7b41692efe1a4908527013b3aea46cb2c9a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because everyone judges him"}], "question": "What makes Shrek want to build a wall around his house?

Before they can engage, an unseen assailant enters and murders them.\n21 years later, Annie Phillips enters a small diner and asks directions to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake. Enos, a truck driver agrees to drive Annie halfway. An elder named Ralph reacts to this by warning Annie that the camp has a \"death curse\". During the drive, Enos explains that a young boy drowned at Crystal Lake in 1957, and the incident the following year. After Enos drops her off, Annie hitches a ride, but the second driver then chases her into the woods and slashes her throat.\nAt the camp, counselors Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda and Alice and owner, Steve Christy refurbish the cabins and facilities. As a storm ensues, Steve leaves campgrounds to stock supplies. Soon, the killer arrives and begins to kill the counselors, including Steve. Worried, Alice and Bill, the only two left, leave the main cabin to investigate only to discover a bloody axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars inoperable. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator and is killed. Alice then heads outside and calls out for him and finds his dead body pinned to the back of the door. She screams and flees back to the main cabin to hide.\nAlice sees a vehicle pull up; thinking its Steve, she rushes out but sees a middle-aged woman named Pamela Voorhees, an \"old friend\" of Christy's. As Alice tries her news, Pamela reveals herself the mother of the drowned boy - Jason, blaming his death on the counselors having sex. She reveals herself the killer when she violently rushes toward Alice with her knife. A chase ensues with Mrs. Vorhees attempting to kill Alice, but she escapes to the shore. Just as she eases, Pamela attempts to kill her again. During the final struggle, Alice decapitates her with a machete.\nAfterwards, a shaken Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe and floats to Crystal Lake's middle.

Marie's step-father, Jay Clifton (Johnson), challenges the will, claiming that Marie isn't ready for the responsibility, but actually wants to take the diamonds for himself. At a sexual education seminar at Marie's school, physician Dr. Chad Johnson (Melendez) and probation officer Kristen Richards (Meyer) discuss sex crimes, and Richards reveals she was a victim of an anonymous rapist many years before.\nAt Marie's swim-meet, Jay encounters towel girl Elena Sandoval (McCoy), and invites her to Marie's eighteenth birthday party. Elena attends the party but is assaulted by Marie, who says that Elena is not welcome. Jay comforts Elena, and brings her to the construction site of one of his buildings for privacy. Later, Elena alleges that Jay raped her at the site. Detective Michael Morrison (Ashby) is placed on the case, as is Richards, who is Elena's probation officer. Chad is placed in charge of documenting Elena's injuries, and testifies to the court that Elena was raped.\nMarie believes that Elena is doing this for money and tells Jay to pay her off. When Jay admits that he's broke, Marie suggests that they sell the diamonds. Jay agrees, and revokes his claim to the will, giving Marie custody of the diamonds so she can sell them off. However, this was a ploy between Elena, Marie and Chad to get the diamonds, and the trio are in a sexual relationship together.\nJay believes that Elena will recant her accusation after being paid off, but at the next court session Elena testifies that Jay also threatened to kill her. Jay is sent to prison, but Richards is now suspicious of Elena's behavior. Richards and Morrison search Elena's trailer and discover she's gathered information about Kristen's rape, using it to form her testimony. Richards and Morrison discuss their suspicions with Jay, and conclude that Marie, Elena and Chad must be working together.\nChad is questioned by Richards and Morrison, and fears they suspect him. He turns on Marie, drugging her and stealing the diamonds. Marie and Elena give chase, following Chad into the woods, where Marie kills him with a tire iron. Marie then meets the diamond buyer Chad set up, but learns that the diamonds are fake. Elena, who is left to deal with Chad's body, is caught by Richards and Morrison.\nRichards and Morrison give Elena a task: wear a wire and get Marie to admit she killed Chad, and the charges against Elena will be lessened. Elena goes to Marie and plays along with her plan to get the real diamonds from Chad's safe at the construction site. Throughout, Elena repeatedly tries to get Marie to confess, but is unsuccessful. When Marie and Elena finally get the diamonds from the safe, Elena pulls a gun on her and flees with the diamonds, prompting Marie to chase her with her own gun. Richards and Morrison, who are listening in from nearby, enter the construction site separately. During the hide-and-seek, Richards finds Marie and shoots her in the chest, killing her. Afterward, Elena claims there were no diamonds, and is escorted from the scene by Richards.\nAt the end it's revealed that Richards and Elena are mother and daughter. Jay was the man that raped Kristen in the past, and Elena is their daughter. During the credits, scenes are shown explaining how they managed to pull their plan off.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diamonds."}], "question": "What kinds of jewels are the

Researchers on the project have yet to devise a system to generate enough power to operate it. When it becomes clear that this weapon has no wartime applications and is intended solely for illegal assassinations, one agent decries the project as immoral and refuses to take part. The remaining agents discuss eliminating the dissenting agent before going to lunch.\nProfessor Jerry Hathaway (Atherton) meets high school student Mitch Taylor (Jarret) at the school's science fair. He informs Mitch that he has been admitted to Pacific Technical University, where he will room with physics \"legend\" Chris Knight (Kilmer). Hathaway is secretly developing the laser for the CIA, but instead of doing the work himself he has his unpaid students do it, while misappropriating the project funding to remodel his house. Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks (such as covering the dorm floor in ice to go skating). Mitch also meets Jordan (Meyrink), a hyperkinetic female student, \"Ick\" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chri's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries), a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet. Hathaway's sycophantic graduate assistant Kent (Prescott) becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the laser project.\nUnder pressure to get results, Hathaway gives Chris an unrealistic timetable, which Chris dismisses. When Mitch is caught attending Chris' pool party instead of working in the lab, Hathaway berates him. The next day Mitch is mortified when a recording of his tearful phone call to his parents is played over a loudspeaker system during lunch, a prank conceived by Kent and his cronies. Humiliated, Mitch is ready to quit school. Chris convinces him to stay by explaining to him that Lazlo was the top genius at Pacific Tech in the 1970s, but suffered a breakdown when he learned that his theories were being used to build weapons. Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to \"crack\" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a \"moral imperative\" to do so. They accomplish this by disassembling Kent's car and rebuilding it inside his dorm room. Kent vows revenge.\nUnder increasing pressure from the CIA, Hathaway berates Chris for failing to solve the laser power problem and promises to fail him and prevent him from graduating. After a pep-talk from Mitch, Chris devotes himself to solving the power problem and achieving a perfect score on Hathaway's final exam. Mitch is accosted by Sherry Nugel (D'arbanville), a beautiful older woman who seeks amorous encounters with the top ten geniuses in the country (which is revealed earlier when she seduces Chris). Mitch turns her down, realizing he's in love with Jordan, and the two become a couple. Though Chris aces Hathway's exam, Chris and Mitch's efforts appear to be ruined when Kent sabotages the laser. In a fit of anger at the laser's destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the power problem. The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.\nWhile the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose. Chris is devastated. Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab. Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him. The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base. While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn. Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove some vital circuits that prevent the laser from overheating. When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn. Kent \"rides\" the flowing popcorn out of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature. The group, reveling in their success, greet an arriving Lazlo accompanied by Sherry Nugel, riding in a motor home pulling a trailer full of prizes from entering a sweepstakes earlier in the movie. He and Sherry indicate they intend to run off together as he is the genius she's been looking for all this time. The film closes with the group and neighborhood children eating the popcorn to the song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by the pop group Tears for Fears.

Needing a new flatmate, they interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner to amuse themselves at the applicants' distress before finally offering the room to the mysterious Hugo (Keith Allen). Shortly after Hugo moves in, the trio find him dead in his room, with a large suitcase full of money. They agree to keep Hugo's death a secret and keep the money for themselves. They agree to bury the body in the woods after removing the hands and feet to prevent identification should it be found. They draw lots and David is given the gruesome and traumatising task of dismembering the corpse, with Juliet disposing of the parts in her hospital's incinerator.\nUnknown to the three friends, Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent men who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo's trail. The flat below Alex, David, and Juliet's is broken into, causing them much apprehension and anxiety. The break-in also draws the attention of the police, who are surprised when the three deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate. While Juliet and Alex spend part of the money to 'feel better', David's fears explode into full-blown paranoia. He hides the suitcase of money in the attic, and begins living there, drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below. The relationship between the three becomes increasingly strained and distrustful, with undertones of sexual tension and rivalry.\nThe men trailing Hugo break into the trio's flat and violently assault Alex and Juliet, until they reveal where the money is. As they each enter the dark attic, David, who has been lying there in wait, kills them with a hammer. David alone visits the same woods to dispose of the two bodies. Alex and Juliet become more worried than ever about David's mental state and David becomes worried that the two are conspiring against him. Meanwhile, the police are already circling, in the form of Detective Inspector McCall (Ken Stott) and Detective constable Mitchell (John Hodge). Juliet secretly buys a plane ticket to South America in anticipation of flight overseas, but also seduces David to get at the money. Matters come to a head after the bodies are discovered by chance\u00e2\u0080\u0094the grave having been too shallow\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Alex is sent by his newspaper to cover the story. He returns to find Juliet and David have reached an understanding about their shared plans that excludes him. That night, Alex, now fearing for his life, tries to secretly phone the police inspector in charge of the case, but he is interrupted by David and Juliet leaving. The doorstep altercation quickly escalates into a murderous triangular fight. David reveals he knows Juliet's secret plan to betray them and attacks her. In the scuffle, David stabs Alex in the chest but is killed by Juliet before he can finish Alex off.\nWith David dead, Juliet tells Alex he can't come with her. She then forces the knife even deeper into Alex's torso, pinning him to the floor, before fleeing to the airport with the suitcase of money. However, arriving at the airport, she discovers that she has been tricked: the suitcase is filled not with money but with hundreds of headline clippings about the triple grave taken from Alex's newspaper. Devastated, with no possessions except her plane ticket, and knowing that she will soon be wanted for murder, Juliet flees the country. The police arrive at the flat to find Alex bleeding heavily and pinned to the floor. The camera pans to under the floor to reveal Alex had hidden the missing bundles of cash under the floorboards.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hugo's money"}], "question": "Who's money do Alex and Juliet spend to feel better?

The island is uninhabited and there are only two bidders, William W. Kolderup, a very wealthy San Franciscan, and his arch-rival J. R. Taskinar, a resident of Stockton, California. Kolderup wins the auction, buying Spencer Island for four million dollars. J. R. Taskinar mutters, \"I will be avenged!\" before retiring to his hotel.\nGodfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with Kolderup, his uncle, and Kolderup's adopted goddaughter, Phina, whom Godfrey has grown to love. Prior to marrying Phina, Godfrey asks to undertake a world tour. Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends Godfrey on a sea voyage around the world on board one of his steamships, the Dream, commanded by Captain Turcott. Godfrey is accompanied by his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka \"Tartlet\".\nAfter some time at sea, Godfrey is awakened one foggy night and told to abandon ship as the Dream is foundering. After jumping into the sea, Godfrey is washed ashore on a deserted island, where he soon finds Tartlet has also been marooned. Godfrey, with scant help from Tartlet, will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face hostile intruders, and overcome other obstacles. Eventually, they are also joined by Carefinotu, whom Godfrey rescues from Polynesians visiting the island. By the end of the story the formerly jaded young man has discovered the value of independent effort, and he gains poise and courage.

Anne Elliot, then 19 years old, fell in love and accepted a proposal of marriage from the handsome young naval officer. He was clever, confident, ambitious, and employed, but not yet wealthy and with no particular family connections to recommend him. Sir Walter, her father and her older sister Elizabeth were not pleased with her choice, maintaining that he was no match for an Elliot of Kellynch Hall, the family estate. Lady Russell, acting in place of Anne's late mother, persuaded her to break the engagement, for she felt it was an imprudent match for one so young. They are the only ones who know about this short engagement, as younger sister Mary was away at school.\nThe Elliot family is now in financial trouble. Kellynch Hall will be let, and the family will settle in Bath until finances improve. Baronet Sir Walter, the socially-conscious father and daughter Elizabeth look forward to the move. Anne is less sure she will enjoy Bath. Mary is married to Charles Musgrove of nearby Uppercross Hall, the heir to a respected local squire. Anne visits Mary and her family, where she is well-loved. The end of the war puts sailors back on shore, including the tenants of Kellynch Hall, Admiral Croft and his wife Sophia, who is the sister of Frederick Wentworth, now a wealthy naval captain. Frederick visits his sister and meets the Uppercross family, including Anne.\nThe Musgroves, including Mary, Charles, and Charles's sisters, Henrietta and Louisa, welcome the Crofts and Wentworth. He tells all he is ready to marry. Henrietta is engaged to her clergyman cousin Charles Hayter, who is away for the first few days that Wentworth joins their social circle. Both the Crofts and Musgroves enjoy speculating about which sister Wentworth might marry. Once Hayter returns, Henrietta turns her affections to him again. Anne still loves Wentworth, so each meeting with him requires preparation for her own strong emotions. She overhears a conversation where Louisa tells Wentworth that Charles first proposed to Anne, who turned him down. This is startling news to him.\nAnne and the young adults of the Uppercross family accompany Captain Wentworth on a visit to two of his fellow officers, Captains Harville and James Benwick, in the coastal town of Lyme Regis. Benwick is in mourning for the death of his fianc\u0102\u0160e, Captain Harville's sister, and he appreciates Anne's sympathy and understanding. He admires the Romantic poets, as does Anne. Anne attracts the attention of a gentleman passing through Lyme, who proves to be William Elliot, her cousin and the heir to Kellynch, who broke ties with Sir Walter years earlier. The last morning of the visit, Louisa sustains a serious concussion in a fall brought about by her impetuous behaviour with Wentworth. Anne coolly organizes the others to summon assistance. Wentworth is impressed with Anne, while feeling guilty about his actions with Louisa. He re-examines his feelings about Anne.\nFollowing this accident, Anne joins her father and sister in Bath with Lady Russell, while Louisa and her parents stay at the Harvilles in Lyme. Wentworth visits his older brother in Shropshire. Anne finds that her father and sister are flattered by the attentions of William Elliot, recently widowed, who has now reconciled with Sir Walter. Elizabeth assumes that he wishes to court her. Although Anne likes William Elliot and enjoys his manners, she finds his character opaque.\nAdmiral Croft and his wife arrive in Bath with the news that Louisa is engaged to Captain Benwick. Wentworth comes to Bath, where his jealousy is piqued by seeing Mr Elliot courting Anne. He and Anne renew their acquaintance. Anne visits an old school friend, Mrs Smith, who is now a widow living in Bath in straitened circumstances. From her she discovers that beneath his charming veneer, Mr Elliot is a cold, calculating opportunist who had led Mrs Smith's late husband into debt. As executor to her husband's will, he takes no actions to improve her situation. Although Mrs Smith believes that he is genuinely attracted to Anne, she feels that his first aim is preventing Mrs Clay from marrying Sir Walter. A new marriage might mean a new son, displacing him.\nThe Musgroves visit Bath to purchase wedding clothes for Louisa and Henrietta, both soon to marry. Captains Wentworth and Harville encounter them and Anne at the Musgroves' hotel in Bath, where Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville conversing about the relative faithfulness of men and women in love. Deeply moved by what Anne has to say about women not giving up their feelings of love even when all hope is lost, Wentworth writes her a note declaring his feelings for her. Outside the hotel, Anne and Wentworth reconcile, affirm their love for each other, and renew their engagement. William Elliot leaves Bath with Mrs Clay, whose charming ways may yet attract him. Lady Russell admits she was wrong about Wentworth; she and Anne remain friends. Once Anne and Frederick marry, he helps Mrs Smith recover her lost assets. Anne settles into life as the wife of a Navy captain, he who is to be called away when his country needs him.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "19"}], "question": "How old was Anne Elliot when she became engaged to Commander Frederick Wentworth?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Admiral Croft and his wife Sophia"}], "question": "By the end of the war, who is residing at Kellynch Hall?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Anne is visiting her sister Mary and Frederick is visiting his sister Sophia"}], "question": "Under what circumstance does Anne meet up with her one-time fiancee Frederick Wentworth?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Henrietta"}], "question": "Frederick learns that Anne had another proposal of marriage from Charles Hayter who is now engaged to which sister of Charles Musgrove?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Romantic period"}], "question": "Captain Harvell is drawn to Anne because they both share a love of poetry from what literary period?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "cousin"}], "question": "What family relationship does Anne share with William Elliott?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "William is executor to Mrs. Smith's late husband's will."}], "question": "What responsibility does William Elliott have to Mrs. Smith?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "William is heir to the family estate, Kellynch Hall."}], "question": "Why is William concerned by the relationship between Mrs. Clay and Sir Walter?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To purchase wedding clothes for Henrietta and Louisa"}], "question": "What brings the Musgroves to Bath?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He helps her recover her lost assets."}], "question": "How does Frederick help Mrs. Smith?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "19"}], "question": "How old was Elizabeth's sister when she agreed to marry Wentworth?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he wasn't wealthy and had not family connections to recommend him"}], "question": "Why wasn't Anne's family happy about Anne's engagement to the Commander?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Russell"}], "question": "Who offered guidance to Sir Walter's middle daughter after her mother died?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "when they fall into financial trouble"}], "question": "When does Anne's family move to Bath?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "in Uppercross Hall"}], "question": "Where does Sir Walter's youngest daughter live?", "id": "55d68540c6b86bc90f7a9e630c8b13c0920bf834"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are Wenworth's sister and brother-in-law"}], "question": "How are the people who rent Kellynch Hall related to Anne's former fiance?

So poor that he is behind on his rent and can barely afford light in his room, he receives three letters. The first is from a friend in Australia who has made his fortune and offers to introduce him to a good friend who might be able to lift him from poverty. The second is a note from a solicitor detailing that he has inherited a fortune from a deceased relative. The third is a letter of introduction from a foreign aristocrat called Lucio, who befriends him and proceeds to be his guide in how to best use his newfound wealth.\nTempest remains blissfully unaware throughout the novel, despite warnings from people he meets, that Lucio is the earthly incarnation of the Devil. Over the course of the book, his wealth leads to misery. Eventually, when confronted with the true nature of his companion, he renounces evil and returns to society penniless but content with the chance to purify his soul.\nAlthough the plot follows Tempest's fall from grace and redemption, he is in many regards a secondary character to Lucio. Both the title of the work and much of its philosophical content relate to the supreme yearning within Satan to achieve salvation. The book's main contribution to Faustian literature is the introduction of the concept that above all other people it is Satan who most truly believes in the Gospel \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet he is

After she returns home, several men kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan Greer (Jason Statham), the group leader, smashes the attic's telephone. Jessica uses the wires of the broken phone and randomly dials a number. She reaches the cell phone of Ryan (Chris Evans), a carefree young man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica Biel).\nJessica persuades Ryan to go to the police station, where he briefly reports to Mooney, but has to leave to avoid losing connection. Ethan asks Jessica about something, which she denies knowing, and leaves to get Ricky. Overhearing them, Ryan gets to Ricky's school, only to see the boy kidnapped. He hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. When his phone battery runs out, he takes the gun in the car, cuts in line at a shop and buys a charger.\nDeciding to check on Ryan's kidnapping claim, Mooney goes to Jessica's house. At the house, he finds Dana Bayback (Valerie Cruz), the kidnappers' accomplice, posing as Jessica. Believing the claim is a false alarm, Mooney leaves. With Ricky in tow, Ethan returns and asks Jessica about a place her husband Craig mentioned, \"The Left Field\", and learns that it is a bar at the Los Angeles International Airport.\nA cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to rob a nearby lawyer's cell phone and car. At the airport, Ryan plants the gun on one of the kidnappers, which trips the alarm. When security intervenes, the kidnappers flash police badges and apprehend Craig. After viewing a news report of a man holding up a store for a charger, Mooney identifies Ryan and calls Jessica's home. He notices the voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met.\nThe kidnappers learns that Craig put a videotape in a bank safe deposit box. One guards Jessica and Ricky, while the rest go to the bank. Ryan finds the box first and leaves with the video camera, but loses the lawyer's cellphone. Watching the videotape, Ryan learns that Craig accidentally filmed LAPD Detective Ethan, Mad Dog, Dimitri, Bayback, Deason, and Jack Tanner (a friend of Mooney's) robbing and murdering drug dealers.\nRyan steals the lawyer's car from the impound lot and retrieves his own cellphone. Mooney returns to the Martin residence, where Bayback injures him. He kills her and learns that she is also a cop. Back at the safe house, Mad Dog learns that Jessica has been trying to contact help and attacks her. Jessica cuts his brachial artery, and he bleeds to death. Before Jessica and Ricky can escape, Ethan's gang returns. Ryan contacts Ethan and makes a deal: the videotape in exchange for the Martin family at the Santa Monica Pier.\nTanner convinces Mooney to go to the pier to identify Ryan. Ryan disguises himself, but is inadvertently exposed by Chloe and identified by Mooney. Tanner sends Mooney away for medical attention, arrests Ryan and brings him to Ethan. Ethan destroys the videotape, and Tanner radios the order to kill the Martins, however, Mooney overhears the radio transmission. Ryan escapes, following a distraction by his friend Chad. Mooney overpowers Dimitri and handcuffs him then returns to the pier. Tanner and Ethan confront Ryan in a boathouse. Ryan knocks out Tanner, but Ethan beats him up until Mooney intervenes. After a brief chase, Ryan notices Ethan has circled behind Mooney, and calls Ethan's cell phone. The phone's ring betrays Ethan's position, and Mooney promptly shoots him to death.\nOn the van, Jessica strangles Deason with her handcuff chain, then frees her husband and son. However, Deason was merely stunned, and aims his gun at them. Ryan intervenes and knocks Deason unconscious. While Ryan and Mooney are being treated by medics, Tanner is also exposed, because Ryan had copied the video recording onto his cell phone, and the Martin family is set free. Jessica finally meets Ryan, the man who risked his life to save her family. When she tells him she doesn't know how to thank him, Ryan replies that he does and half-heartedly tells her to not call him again.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the school

been rendered an uninhabitable wasteland by a Soviet \"Hell Bomb,\" though the rest of the city is still occupied. The narrator is a British citizen named Wysten Turner, who is in New York to barter, in exchange for grain, electronic equipment that he suspects will be used in the construction of an American military base on the moon.\nAs the story begins, he pulls a young woman out of the way of a car; apparently it is a favorite gang activity to snag women's clothing with fishhooks welded to their cars' fenders, although this car came a bit too close. Turner involves the police, but they do not regard the incident as serious, and he ends up bribing them to go away. The wearing of masks, akin to the Muslim burka but carrying no religious significance, has become all but mandatory for fashionable American women. Turner therefore cannot see the face of the woman he has helped, and he is intrigued.\nShe arranges for him to meet her later, and they go to a nightclub. She begs him to help her escape America, explaining that her boyfriend, a professional wrestler, beats her when he loses a wrestling match. Turner's sense of chivalry is aroused, and a fight occurs when the boyfriend arrives. Turner, to his surprise, knocks the boyfriend down, but when he does, the girl turns on him rather than thanking him for defending her. Her quasi-seduction of Turner is a ploy she's used on other men in the past, as all those around her already know. She never intended to leave the wrestler, as she craves his abuse. Turner rips the mask from her face, but is repulsed by her lack of grooming and by her expression of hatred. He leaves, anxious to return to England.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a Soviet Hell Bomb"}], "question": "What rendered midtown Manhattan an uninhabitable waste land?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "England"}], "question": "What country is Wysten Turner a citizen of?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to barter"}], "question": "Why is Turner in NY?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "grain"}], "question": "What does Turner intend to barter with?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "electronic equipment"}], "question": "What doe Turner intend to barter for?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "construction of an American military base on the moon"}], "question": "What does Turner think the electronic equipment will be used for?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a car"}], "question": "What does Turner pull a woman out of the way of?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "women wear burka-like coverings"}], "question": "Why can Turner not see the face of the woman he helped?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "it is fashionable"}], "question": "Why do the women wear the burka-like coverings?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a nightclub"}], "question": "Where does Turner go with the woman he helped?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Midtown Manhattan"}], "question": "Which part of Manhattan is left uninhabitable by the Soviet \"Hell Bomb\"?", "id": "57cc5523770d264c141abd6a01f7acdaf080c633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Electronic equipment.

The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0089James Joyce, Opening to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\nThe childhood of Stephen Dedalus is recounted using vocabulary that changes as he grows, in a voice not his own but sensitive to his feelings. The reader experiences Stephen's fears and bewilderment as he comes to terms with the world in a series of disjointed episodes. Stephen attends the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, where the apprehensive, intellectually gifted boy suffers the ridicule of his classmates while he learns the schoolboy codes of behaviour. While he cannot grasp their significance, at a Christmas dinner he is witness to the social, political and religious tensions in Ireland involving Charles Stewart Parnell, which drive wedges between members of his family, leaving Stephen with doubts over which social institutions he can place his faith in. Back at Clongowes, word spreads that a number of older boys have been caught \"smugging\"; discipline is tightened, and the Jesuits increase use of corporal punishment. Stephen is strapped when one of his instructors believes he has broken his glasses to avoid studying, but, prodded by his classmates, Stephen works up the courage to complain to the rector, Father Conmee, who assures him there will be no such recurrence, leaving Stephen with a sense of triumph.\nStephen's father gets into debt and the family leaves its pleasant suburban home to live in Dublin. Stephen realises that he will not return to Clongowes. However, thanks to a scholarship obtained for him by Father Conmee, Stephen is able to attend Belvedere College, where he excels academically and becomes a class leader. Stephen squanders a large cash prize from school, and begins to see prostitutes, as distance grows between him and his drunken father.\nAs Stephen abandons himself to sensual pleasures, his class is taken on a religious retreat, where the boys sit through sermons. Stephen pays special attention to those on pride, guilt, punishment and the Four Last Things (death, judgement, Hell, and Heaven). He feels that the words of the sermon, describing horrific eternal punishment in hell, are directed at himself and, overwhelmed, comes to desire forgiveness. Overjoyed at his return to the Church, he devotes himself to acts of ascetic repentance, though they soon devolve to mere acts of routine, as his thoughts turn elsewhere. His devotion comes to the attention of the Jesuits, and they encourage him to consider entering the priesthood. Stephen takes time to consider, but has a crisis of faith because of the conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his aesthetic ambitions. Along Dollymount Strand he spots a girl wading, and has an epiphany in which he is overcome with the desire to find a way to express her beauty in his writing.\nAs a student at University College, Dublin, Stephen grows increasingly wary of the institutions around him: Church, school, politics and family. In the midst of the disintegration of his family's fortunes his father berates him and his mother urges him to return to the Church. An increasingly dry, humourless Stephen explains his alienation from the Church and the aesthetic theory he has developed to his friends, who find that they cannot accept either of them. Stephen concludes that Ireland is too restricted to allow him to express himself fully as an artist, so he decides that he will have to leave. He sets his mind on self-imposed exile, but not without declaring in his diary his ties to his homeland:\n... I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

American survivors evacuated to gigantic bunkers miles under ground. Sophisticated, radioactivity-immune robots called \"leadys\" continue fighting the war on the devastated surface that is far too dangerous for humans. The Soviets have similarly evacuated underground, and each side builds powerful weapons and vehicles for the remote-controlled war they only see from film that the robots deliver.\nThe security department asks Taylor, an American war planner, to observe the interrogation of a leady regarding the progress of the war. Although the robot reports that lethal radioactivity and sophisticated new Soviet weapons continue to make the surface dangerous for humans, the observers find that the leady is not radioactive. Taylor learns that this is the second such robot the security department has found; it assigns him to an expedition, wearing lead suits, to investigate the truth about surface conditions.\nTaylor's group surprises the leadys at the surface and demands to see the outside. Although the robots attempt to delay the humans as long as possible, the group discovers outside the bunker an undamaged valley with forests, animals, and a farm. The leadys reveal that the war ended as soon as the humans evacuated because the robots could not see a rational purpose for it. Analyzing history, they found that groups of humans warred with each other until they matured to overcome conflict. Humanity is almost ready for a single culture, the current worldwide division into American and Soviet sides being the final step. The leadys created counterfeit photographs of the devastated planet to fool humans, while destroying weapons they received and rebuilding the world for their creators' return.\nThe Americans believe that because the Soviets do not know that they were also tricked, the United States can quickly win the war. The robots reveal, however, that during their explanation they sealed all tubes to under ground. Although this prevents the expedition from leaving, the leadys expect that by the time their countrymen dig new tunnels, humanity will be ready for the truth. The robots invite Taylor and the others to join a group of Soviets who were similarly stranded after visiting the surface. \"The working out of daily problems of existence\", the leadys suggest, \"will teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but it will be done.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The robots did see a rational purpose for the war.

When Jerry owes money to a group of sailors, he takes Estelle and Nick to a trailer park in Clearlake where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders, a bright young woman his age, with an interest in French culture and who shares Nick's musical taste. Despite Sheeni's boyfriend, Trent Preston, they become romantically involved. Nick purchases a dog for Sheeni named Albert (after Albert Camus), but the dog rips up the family Bible and Sheeni's parents ban it from the house.\nJerry needs to return to Oakland and takes Estelle and Nick with him. Sheeni promises to arrange a job in Ukiah for Nick's father, George, while Nick will get his mother to kick him out so he can return to Sheeni. Back at home, Nick creates an alter-ego named Fran\u0e23\u0e07ois Dillinger, a suave, rebellious troublemaker. Immediately after Nick makes the decision, Jerry dies of a heart attack. Under Fran\u0e23\u0e07ois' influence, Nick mouths off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer Lance Wescott. Nick takes Jerry's Lincoln, and crashes into a restaurant, which starts a fire. Lance agrees to lie and report the car stolen. In return, Nick must live with his father. In Ukiah, Nick phones Sheeni and tells her he had to blow up \"half of Berkeley\" to return. Sheeni's parents overhear this and ship her to a French boarding school in Santa Cruz, forbidding Nick ever to see her again.\nIn his new high school, Nick befriends Vijay Joshi, and they take Vijay's grandmother's car to visit Sheeni. After being allowed into Sheeni's room, Nick goes to the restroom and meets Bernice Lynch, Sheeni's neighbor, and claims Trent said terrible things about her. Bernice brings the matron to Sheeni's room and the boys flee. On the way home, the car dies and Nick calls Mr. Ferguson, his father's idealist neighbor, to come pick them up; he tells Ferguson that Vijay is an illegal immigrant whom Nick is trying to \"free from persecution\".\nWhen he returns home, Nick meets Sheeni's older brother, Paul, who tells him that she will be returning home on Thanksgiving and invites him for dinner. Nick begins to send Bernice letters asking her to slip sedatives into Sheeni's drinks to make her fall asleep in class, thereby getting Sheeni expelled. Nick finds Lacey, George's 25-year-old girlfriend, Paul, and Ferguson, lounging in his living room, high on mushrooms, which Nick also ingests. George finds them and punches Ferguson, which results in Paul punching George. Lacey leaves the house to live with Paul. On Thanksgiving Day, Nick receives a call from his mother explaining Lance left and will not cover for Nick anymore. Nick goes to Thanksgiving at Sheeni's. Trent unexpectedly arrives and explains Nick's letters to Bernice; Sheeni is horrified and Nick leaves.\nNick steals his father's car to escape the police. He then removes his clothes and drives the car into a shallow lake in front of the police station. He buys a wig and a dress and impersonates one of Sheeni's \"friends\". He fools Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and goes up to Sheeni's room. Upstairs, Nick tells Sheeni that he understands what loneliness is like, and that everything he has done, including burning down Berkeley, destroying his parents' cars and having her sedated were all so that they wouldn't have to be alone anymore. Sheeni forgives Nick, and the two have sex, finally achieving Nick's dream of losing his virginity. Trent barges in, telling Nick he's brought the police with him. Nick beats up Trent and asks Sheeni to wait for him; Sheeni reassures him that he will only be in juvenile detention for three months.\nThe animated closing credits show Nick in jail with Fran\u0e23\u0e07ois helping him. When Nick is released, Sheeni shows up in a car and they drive away into the sky towards the Paris skyline, as various characters appear to make amends with the two and give them their blessing.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because his mom's boyfriend owes money to some men."}], "question": "Why does Nick and his family move to a trailer park?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sheeni was going to arrange for a job for Nick's dad while Nick got his mother to kick him out of the house."}], "question": "What is Nick and Sheeni's plan?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He stole Jerry's car, crashed it into a restaurant, which started a fire."}], "question": "What did Nick do after an arguement with his mom and her new boyfriend?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They send her off to a French boarding school."}], "question": "Where do Sheeni's parents send her after overhearing her and Nick?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That he is an illegal immigrant that Nick is trying to free."}], "question": "What does Nick tell Fergueson about his friend, Vijay?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To put sleeping pills in Sheeni's drinks, so that she would fall asleep in class."}], "question": "What did Nick ask Bernice to do to get Sheeni expelled?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That she broke up with Lance and that Lance wasn't going to cover for his crimes anymore."}], "question": "What does Nick's mom tell him at Thanksgiving?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He took his clothes off and drove it into a shallow lake."}], "question": "What does Nick do after he steals his father's car?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He puts on a wig and a dress and pretends to be one of Sheeni's friends."}], "question": "What does Nick do to fool Sheeni's parents?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was there for three months."}], "question": "How long did Nick spend in detention?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jerry is Estelle's boyfriend"}], "question": "What is Jerry's relationship to Estelle?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nick is Estelle's son"}], "question": "What is Nick Twisp's relationship to Estelle?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "French culture"}], "question": "What type of culture is Sheeni Saunders interested in?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A dog"}], "question": "What does Nick buy for Sheeni?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Albert"}], "question": "What is Sheeni's dog's name?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Albert Camus"}], "question": "Who is Sheeni's dog named after?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Bible"}], "question": "What does Albert tear up and destroy?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Paul is Sheeni's brother"}], "question": "What is Paul's relationship to Sheeni?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Ferguson"}], "question": "Who does Nick call when Vijay's grandmother's car breaks down?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A wig and a dress"}], "question": "What does Nick don to impersonate one of Sheeni's friends?", "id": "5928634792e42a8c40fccd4f53be1f49c670edc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A group of sailors.

Its main storyline features the courtship of the Rev. Mr Crawley's daughter, Grace, and Major Henry Grantly, son of the wealthy Archdeacon Grantly. The Archdeacon, although allowing that Grace is a lady, doesn't think her of high enough rank or wealth for his widowed son; his position is strengthened by the Reverend Mr Crawley's apparent crime. Almost broken by poverty and trouble, the Reverend Mr Crawley hardly knows himself if he is guilty or not; fortunately, the mystery is resolved just as Major Grantly's determination and Grace Crawley's own merit force the Archdeacon to overcome his prejudice against her as a daughter-in-law. As with Lucy Robarts in Framley Parsonage, the objecting parent finally invites the young lady into the family; this new connection also inspires the Dean and Archdeacon to find a new, more prosperous, post for Grace's impoverished father.\nThrough death or marriage, this final volume manages to tie up more than one thread from the beginning of the series. One subplot deals with the death of Mrs. Proudie, the virago wife of the Bishop of Barchester, and his subsequent grief and collapse. Mrs. Proudie, upon her arrival in Barchester in Barchester Towers, had increased the tribulations of the gentle Mr. Harding, title character of The Warden; he dies of a peaceful old age, mourned by his family and the old men he loved and looked after as Warden.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Old age"}], "question": "How did Mr. Harding die?", "id": "5a3c3fa94456d41df5d8711b33687c39f2aa1ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mrs. Proudie"}], "question": "Who was the Bishop of Barchester's wife?", "id": "5a3c3fa94456d41df5d8711b33687c39f2aa1ca8"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a Cheque"}], "question": "What is the Reverend Joseph Crawley accused of stealing?

on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around on nearby Isla Sorna during a family vacation, and survives an attack by a swarm of Compsognathus. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, to help rally public support against human interference on the island. After learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on the island, Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna, but only to retrieve her.\nIan meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp.\nNick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer. The infant is released to the adult T. rexes, which then attack the trailer, pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff. Eddie soon arrives, but as he tries to pull the trailer back over the edge with an SUV, the adult T. rexes return and devour him. The trailer and the SUV both plummet off the cliff. Ian, Sarah, and Nick are rescued by the InGen team, along with Kelly. With both groups' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed, they team up to reach the old InGen compound's radio station on foot.\nThe next night, the two adult T. rexes find the group's camp. The female T. rex chases the group to a waterfall cave, while Roland tranquilizes the male. Much of the remaining InGen team is killed by Velociraptors while fleeing through a tall grass savannah. Nick runs ahead to the communications center at the InGen Worker's Village to call for rescue. When Ian, Sarah and Kelly arrive, they are attacked by the raptors. They evade the raptors until a helicopter arrives and transports them off the island.\nA freighter transports the male T. rex to the mainland, but crashes into the dock after the crew is killed by a creature of unknown species. A guard opens the cargo hold, accidentally releasing the T. rex, which escapes into San Diego and goes on a rampage. Ian and Sarah retrieve the infant T. rex from a secure InGen building and use it to lure the adult back to the ship. Ludlow tries to intervene but is trapped in the cargo hold by the adult T. rex and mauled by the infant. Before the adult can escape again, Sarah tranquilizes it while Ian closes the hold. The T. rexes are escorted back to Isla Sorna, and Hammond says that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a nature preserve, affirming that \"life will find a way\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Isla Sorna"}], "question": "Where were the dinosaurs created before being relocated to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To retrieve his girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding"}], "question": "Why does Doctor Ian Malcolm agree to go to Isla Sorna?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By luring it with the cries of its injured infant"}], "question": "How does Roland Tembo plan to catch the male Tyrannosaurus?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A broken leg"}], "question": "What injury does the infant T. rex suffer from?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Eddie"}], "question": "Who is devoured while attempting to save the trailer from falling over the cliff?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Velociraptors "}], "question": "What type of dinosaurs attack the InGen team members as they run through the tall grass savannah?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A helicopter comes to their rescue"}], "question": "How are Ian, Sarah, and Kelly eventually saved from the raptors?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A guard accidentally releases him from the cargo hold"}], "question": "How is the male T. rex able to escape into San Diego?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She tranquilizes it"}], "question": "What does Sarah do to stop the T. rex from escaping again?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They declare it a nature preserve"}], "question": "What do the American and Costa Rican governments decide to do with Isla Sorna?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "genetics"}], "question": "What type of company was sued by Cathy's parents?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "hurricane"}], "question": "Why did Peter's uncle say they left the island where the dinosaurs were created?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to retrieve his girlfriend"}], "question": "Why did the Mathematician who met with Hammond agree to go to Isla Sorna?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "After learning that they were to be relocated to San Diego"}], "question": "When did Dr. Harding help to free the dinosaurs caged in InGen's camp?", "id": "5a81bf6783717a5cbbd593a895610f112b6bff2f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The US and Costa Rica"}], "question": "Which countries declared that Isla Sorna was a nature preserve?

Charlie chooses that person because he said that he heard he was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.\nHis English teacher, Mr. Anderson, notices Charlie's passion for reading and writing, and acts as a mentor by assigning him extracurricular books and reports. Although he is a wallflower, Charlie is befriended by two seniors: Patrick and Sam. Patrick is secretly dating Brad, a closeted football player, and Sam is Patrick's stepsister. Charlie quickly develops a crush on Sam and subsequently admits his feelings to her. It is revealed that Sam was sexually abused as a child, and she kisses Charlie to ensure that his first kiss is from someone who truly loves him.\nIn parallel, Charlie witnesses his sister's boyfriend hit her across the face, but she forbids him from telling their parents. He eventually mentions the occurrence to Mr. Anderson, who tells Charlie's parents about it. Charlie's relationship with his sister rapidly deteriorates and she continues to see her boyfriend against her parents' wishes. Eventually, he discovers that his sister is pregnant and agrees to bring her to an abortion clinic without telling anyone. His sister breaks up with her boyfriend, after which her and Charlie's relationship begins to improve significantly.\nCharlie is accepted by Sam and Patrick's group of friends and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. As Charlie engages with his new friends he can control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, who died in a car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. Eventually, Mary Elizabeth, a member of the group, invites Charlie to the school's Sadie Hawkins dance and the two enter into a desultory relationship. During a game of Truth or Dare, when dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room he kisses Sam; Mary Elizabeth storms out, the rest of the group shuns him and Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while. His flashbacks return.\nPatrick and Brad's relationship is discovered by Brad's abusive father, and Brad disappears from school for a few days. Upon returning, Brad is cold and mean towards Patrick, while Patrick attempts to reconnect with him. However, when Brad derogatorily attacks Patrick's sexuality in public, Patrick physically attacks Brad until other football players join in and gang up on Patrick. Charlie breaks up the fight, regaining the respect of Sam and her friends. Patrick begins spending much of his time with Charlie and Patrick kisses Charlie impulsively and then apologizes, but Charlie understands that he is recovering from his romance with Brad. Soon Patrick sees Brad engaging with a stranger in the park and Patrick is able to move on from the relationship.\nAs the school year ends, Charlie is anxious about losing his older friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially Sam, who is leaving for a summer college-preparatory program and has learned that her boyfriend cheated on her. When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his feelings for her; she is angry that he never acted on them. They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realise that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his aunt Helen as a little boy.\nIn an epilogue, Charlie is discovered by his parents in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it emerges that Helen sexually abused him when he was young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.\nHe comes to terms with his past: \"Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there\". Charlie decides to \"participate\" in life, and his letter-writing ends.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is a 15 year-old boy who is quiet and sensitive.

A mysterious group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the virus. In 2035, James Cole (Willis) is a prisoner living in a subterranean shelter beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected for a mission, where he is trained and sent back in time to collect information on the virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting.\nCole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), a fellow mental patient with fanatical views. After an escape attempt, Cole is locked in a cell, but soon disappears, returning to the future. Back in his own time, Cole is interviewed by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which discloses the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and asserts their association with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. He is given a second chance to go back in time, but another error results in him arriving at a battlefield of World War I. He is wounded in the leg and then suddenly sent to 1996.\nIn 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters (Morse) questions her about mankind's sustainability on earth and points out that humanity's gradual destruction of the environment may be the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the virus and says that wiping out humanity was Cole's idea at the asylum in 1990.\nCole convinces himself that he is insane, but Railly confronts him with evidence of his time travel. They decide to spend their remaining time together in the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' Nobel Prize winning virologist father (Plummer) in an animal cage.\nAt the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose (Seda), an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.\nCole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing the gun he was given, Cole is fatally shot by police. As Cole lies dying in Railly's arms, she makes eye contact with a small boy\u00e2\u0080\u0094the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come.

\"medical\" and social interpretation of what has created this Degeneration in society. Nordau divides his study into five books. In the first book, Nordau identifies the phenomenon of fin de si\u0102\u00a8cle in Europe. He sees this as first being recognised, though not originating, in France, describing this phenomenon as \"a contempt for the traditional views of custom and morality\". He sees it as a sort of decadence, a world-weariness, and the wilful rejection of the moral boundaries governing the world. He uses examples from French periodicals and books in French to show how it has affected all elements of society. Nordau accuses also society of becoming more and more inclined to imitate what they see in art. He sees in the fashionable society of Paris and London that \"[e]very single figure strives visibly by some singularity in outline, set, cut or colour, to startle attention violently, and imperiously to detain it. Each one wishes to create a strong nervous excitement, no matter whether agreeably or disagreeably\".\nNordau establishes the cultural phenomenon of fin de si\u0102\u00a8cle in the opening pages, but he quickly moves to the viewpoint of a physician and identifies what he sees as an illness:\nIn the fin-de-si\u0102\u00a8cle disposition, in the tendencies of contemporary art and poetry, in the life and conduct of men who write mystic, symbolic and 'decadent' works and the attitude taken by their admirers in the tastes and aesthetic instincts of fashionable society, the confluence of two well-defined conditions of disease, with which he [the physician] is quite familiar, viz. degeneration and hysteria, of which the minor stages are designated as neurasthenia.\nThe book deals with numerous case studies of various artists, writers and thinkers (Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to name a few), but its basic premise remains that society and human beings themselves are degenerating, and this degeneration is both reflected in and influenced by art. Hannah Arendt, in her book The Origins of Totalitarianism, refers to late 19th Century French society as embracing unusual or exotic types or individuals, such as criminals, Gypsies and Turks, and certain others formerly not seen as socially acceptable, so Nordau's position is not novel or isolated as social criticism.\nThe original article's text comports quite closely to Howard Fertig, NY 1960. During the time of Nordau's writing, physical, physiognomic, or mechanical factors were still being regarded as causative in mental aberrations and malfunctions. The symbolic or mythic approached later implemented by Freud and Jung made no part of Nordau's understanding of the human psyche.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The viewpoint of a

before they act, reducing the murder rate to zero. Murders are predicted using three mutated humans, called \"Precogs\", who \"previsualize\" crimes by receiving visions of the future. Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality. The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program.\nSince the disappearance of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has separated from his wife Lara and becomes a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the Precogs, usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a \"minority report\" of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence.\nAnderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the city-wide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.\nAnderton and Agatha go to Crow's apartment as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him to be a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.\nWitwer, studying Crow's death, suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the Precogs still offline, the murder is not detected.\nLara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her, and Anderton is captured, accused of both murders, and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep. As his body is deposited into the prison, the warden tells him, \"that all your dreams come true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAgatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.\nAfter Burgess's death, the PreCrime system is shut down and all prisoners pardoned. Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together. The Precogs are sent to an isolated island to live their lives in peace.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "John Anderton"}], "question": "Who became a drug addict?

(His first name is never revealed; other characters in the novel call him simply \"Mac\".) His best friend, Marcus Schouler, brings his cousin, Trina Sieppe, whom he is courting, to McTeague's parlor for dental work. McTeague becomes infatuated with her while working on her teeth, and Marcus graciously steps aside. McTeague successfully woos Trina. Shortly after McTeague and Trina have kissed and declared their love for each other, Trina discovers that she has won $15,000 from a lottery ticket. In the ensuing celebration Trina's mother, Mrs Sieppe, announces that McTeague and Trina are to marry. Marcus becomes jealous of McTeague, and claims that he has been cheated out of money that would have been rightfully his if he had married Trina.\nThe marriage takes place, and Mrs Sieppe, along with the rest of Trina's family, move away from San Francisco, leaving her alone with McTeague. Trina proves to be a parsimonious wife; she refuses to touch the principal of her $15,000, which she invests with her uncle. She insists that she and McTeague must live on the earnings from McTeague's dental practice, the small income from the $15,000 investment, and the bit of money she earns from carving small wooden figures of Noah's animals and his Ark for sale in her uncle's shop. Secretly, she accumulates penny-pinched savings in a locked trunk. Though the couple are happy, the friendship between Marcus and Mac deteriorates. More than once the two men come to grips; each time McTeague's immense physical strength prevails, and eventually he breaks Marcus' arm in a fight. When Marcus recovers, he goes south, intending to become a rancher; before he leaves, he visits the McTeagues, and he and Mac part apparently as friends.\nCatastrophe strikes when McTeague is debarred from practising dentistry by the authorities; it becomes clear that before leaving, Marcus has taken revenge on Mac by informing city hall that he has no license or degree. McTeague loses his practice and the couple are forced to move into successively poorer quarters as Trina becomes more and more miserly. Their life together deteriorates until McTeague takes all Trina's domestic savings (amounting to $400 or roughly $10,000 in 2010 values) and abandons her. Meanwhile, Trina falls completely under the spell of money and withdraws the principal of her prior winnings in gold from her uncle's firm so she can admire and handle the coins in her room, at one point spreading them over her bed and rolling around in them.\nWhen McTeague returns, destitute once more, she refuses to give him money even for food. Aggravated and made violent by whisky, McTeague beats her to death. He takes the entire hoard of gold and heads out to a mining community that he had left years before. Sensing pursuit, he makes his way south towards Mexico; meanwhile, Marcus hears of the murder and joins the hunt for McTeague, finally catching him in Death Valley. In the middle of the desert Marcus and McTeague fight over McTeague's remaining water and, when that is lost and they are already doomed, over Trina's $15,000. McTeague kills Marcus, but as he dies, Marcus handcuffs himself to McTeague. The final, dramatic image of the novel is one of McTeague stranded, alone and helpless. He is left with only the company of Marcus's corpse, to whom he is handcuffed, in the desolate, arid waste of Death Valley.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Dentist."}],

Grandson, Morat (both 1476) and Nancy (1477), all mentioned in Act I, scene ii. The protagonist's father, the elder Charalois, was a general who had gone into debt to pay the expenses of his troops; unable to repay those charges, he died in debtor's prison, and his rapacious creditors refuse to release his body for a proper burial. The general's son has taken his cause to court, but his suit is rejected by the judges, led by the hostile Novall Senior, president of the Dijon parlement. The younger Charalois amazes everyone by offering to assume his father's debts and take his place in prison, thus freeing his father's corpse. A retiring judge named Rochmont is impressed by Charalois' courage, virtue, and self-sacrifice, and decides to pay the general's debts himself.\nRochmont has an only daughter named Beaumelle; she is the centre of a set of fashionable and foppish young people, featuring the aristocratic Novall Junior and his hangers-on. Beaumelle's waiting-woman, Bellapert, is a cynical sensualist who tempts her mistress with the idea of marrying to enjoy sexual indulgence with many illicit lovers. Beaumelle's father is so taken with Charalois that he arranges a marriage between the young man and his daughter.\nNovall Junior is irate about the marriage, since he has lost his chance of taking Beaumelle's virginity; but Bellapert assures him that the marriage will work to his advantage. Others, including Charalois' friend Romont, perceive the growing intimacy of Novall Junior and Beaumelle, and try to warn the parties involved\u00e2\u0080\u0094without success. Eventually, Beaumelle consummates her incipient affair with Novall Junior\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Charalois walks in upon them, catching them in the act. Charalois challenges his wife's lover; Novall Junior attempts to avoid the duel, but in the end he fights with Charalois, and is killed.\nCharalois stages a mock trial, with his father-in-law Rochmont as the judge. Rochmont, even in his emotional turmoil, hears Charalois' accusation and Beaumelle's confession, and sentences her to death. Charalois stabs her; Beaumelle dies.

She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fianc\u0102\u0160, Mark, but when he dumps her after learning she is only after his money, Elizabeth must resume her job. She tries to win over substitute teacher Scott Delacorte, who is also wealthy because his family runs a watch company. Amy Squirrel, a dedicated but overly enthusiastic colleague, also pursues Scott while the school's gym teacher, Russell Gettis, makes it clear that he is interested in Elizabeth romantically; she, however, is not interested in him because he's just a gym teacher.\nEarly in the film, Elizabeth plans to get surgery to enlarge her breasts, and becomes all the more motivated to do so once she learns Scott's ex-girlfriend had large breasts. However, when she tries to schedule an appointment for her breast surgery, she cannot afford the $9,300 procedure. To make things worse, Scott admits that he has a crush on Amy, and that he only likes Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to Elizabeth pursuing Scott and ignoring school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeth's embezzlement scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless.\nElizabeth later learns from her best friend, Lynn Davies, that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus. With this knowledge, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to intensely read and study To Kill A Mockingbird for the upcoming test. However, the change is too late and insufficient. The students have terrible scores on their quizzes, frustrating her even more. Meanwhile, she befriends Russell the gym teacher as Amy and Scott start dating. Desperate to pay off the procedure for her breast surgery, Elizabeth steals the state test answers by disguising herself as a journalist and seducing Carl Halabi, a state official who is in charge of creating and distributing the exams. Elizabeth gets Carl drunk and convinces him to take her to his office to have sex, but she spikes his drink and steals a copy of the answers. A month later, Elizabeth's class aces the test and she wins the bonus, giving her the funds needed to get her breasts enlarged.\nWhen Elizabeth learns that Amy and Scott are chaperoning an upcoming field trip, she smears an apple with poison ivy and leaves it for Amy, who ends up with her face breaking out in blisters, so she cannot go. On the trip, Elizabeth seduces Scott. They dry hump and Elizabeth secretly calls Amy using Scott's phone leaving a message recording all the action, ensuring she knows about the affair. However, Scott's peculiar behavior, which was subtly exposed by Russell, disappoints Elizabeth. Elizabeth later gives advice to one of her students who has an unrequited crush on the superficial Chase in class, which causes her to reflect on how she has been superficial as well. On a field trip the boy makes an embarrassing public confession of his love and is ridiculed by his classmates. Elizabeth takes him aside, gives him her bra, and tells everyone she caught him having sex with a student from another school, which erases his image as a loser.\nLeft behind at the school, Amy switches Elizabeth's desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeth's sealed drawer. Amy finds Elizabeth's journalist disguise and the practice test, which leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and, with the help of her roommate, Kirk, uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having failed to nail Elizabeth for cheating, Amy accuses her of drug use, based on a tip from a student. When the police arrive and bring their sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeth's mini liquor bottles, marijuana and OxyContin pills in Amy's classroom, in a secret compartment in Elizabeth's desk which Elizabeth helpfully points out to the police. At the end of the school year, Amy is moved to the worst school in the county by the superintendent.

A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere.\n\u2014\u2009Washington Irving, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\"\nThe story is set in 1790 in the countryside around the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town (historical Tarrytown, New York), in a secluded glen called Sleepy Hollow. Sleepy Hollow is renowned for its ghosts and the haunting atmosphere that pervades the imaginations of its inhabitants and visitors. Some residents say this town was bewitched during the early days of the Dutch settlement. Other residents say an old [[Native Americans in the Unit ella Wilson is the best ed States|Native American]] chief, the wizard of his tribe, held his powwows here before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. The most infamous spectre in the Hollow is the Headless Horseman, said to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper that had his head shot off by a stray cannonball during \"some nameless battle\" of the American Revolutionary War, and who \"rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head\".\nThe \"Legend\" relates the tale of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who competes with Abraham \"Brom Bones\" Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and sole child of a wealthy farmer, Baltus Van Tassel. Crane, a Yankee and an outsider, sees marriage to Katrina as a means of procuring Van Tassel's extravagant wealth. Bones, the local hero, vies with Ichabod for Katrina's hand, playing a series of pranks on the jittery schoolmaster, and the fate of Sleepy Hollow's fortune weighs in the balance for some time. The tension between the three is soon brought to a head. On a placid autumn night, the ambitious Crane attends a harvest party at the Van Tassels' homestead. He dances, partakes in the feast, and listens to ghostly legends told by Brom and the locals, but his true aim is to propose to Katrina after the guests leave. His intentions, however, are ill-fated.\nAfter having failed to secure Katrina's hand, Ichabod rides home \"heavy-hearted and crestfallen\" through the woods between Van Tassel's farmstead and the Sleepy Hollow settlement. As he passes several purportedly haunted spots, his active imagination is engorged by the ghost stories told at Baltus' harvest party. After nervously passing under a lightning-stricken tulip tree purportedly haunted by the ghost of British spy Major Andr\u00e9, Ichabod encounters a cloaked rider at an intersection in a menacing swamp. Unsettled by his fellow traveler's eerie size and silence, the teacher is horrified to discover that his companion's head is not on his shoulders, but on his saddle. In a frenzied race to the bridge adjacent to the Old Dutch Burying Ground, where the Hessian is said to \"vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone\" upon crossing it, Ichabod rides for his life, desperately goading his temperamental plow horse down the Hollow. However, to the pedagogue's horror, the ghoul clambers over the bridge, rears his horse, and hurls his severed head into Ichabod's terrified face.\nThe next morning, Ichabod has mysteriously disappeared from town, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones, who was said \"to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related.\" Indeed, the only relics of the schoolmaster's flight are his wandering horse, trampled saddle, discarded hat, and a mysterious shattered pumpkin. Although the nature of the Headless Horseman is left open to interpretation, the story implies that the ghost was really Brom (an agile stunt rider) in disguise. Irving's narrator concludes, however, by stating that the old Dutch wives continue to promote the belief that Ichabod was \"spirited away by supernatural means,\" and a legend develops around his disappearance and sightings of his melancholy spirit.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ghost and hunting stories."}], "question": "What was  Sleepy Hollow know for?", "id":

end within a month. However, he is concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts once the war has concluded and that the proposed Thirteenth Amendment will be defeated by the returning slave states. Lincoln feels it is imperative to pass the amendment by the end of the month, thus removing any possibility that slaves who have already been freed may be re-enslaved. The Radical Republicans fear the amendment will be defeated by some who merely wish to delay its passage; the support of the amendment by Republicans in the border states is not yet assured either, since they prioritize the issue of ending the war. Even if all of them are ultimately brought on board, the amendment will still require the support of several Democratic congressmen if it is to pass. With dozens of Democrats having just become lame ducks after losing their re-election campaigns in the fall of 1864, some of Lincoln's advisors believe that he should wait until the new Republican-heavy Congress is seated, presumably giving the amendment an easier road to passage. Lincoln, however, remains adamant about having the amendment in place and the issue of slavery settled before the war is concluded and the southern states readmitted into the Union.\nLincoln's hopes for passage of the amendment rely upon the support of Francis Preston Blair, a founder of the Republican Party whose influence can ensure that all members of the western and border state conservative Republican faction will back the amendment. With Union victory in the Civil War seeming highly likely and greatly anticipated, but not yet a fully accomplished fact, and with two sons serving in the Union Army, Blair is keen to end the hostilities as soon as possible. Therefore, in return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to immediately engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations. This is a complication to Lincoln's amendment efforts since he knows that a significant portion of the support he has garnered for the amendment is from the Radical Republican faction for whom a negotiated peace that leaves slavery intact is morally unacceptable. Unable to proceed without Blair's support, however, Lincoln reluctantly authorizes Blair's mission.\nIn the meantime, Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward work on the issue of securing the necessary Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests that they concentrate on the lame duck Democrats, as they have already lost re-election and thus will feel free to vote as they please, rather than having to worry about how their vote will affect a future re-election campaign. Since those members also will soon be in need of employment and Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term, he sees this as a tool he can use to his advantage. Though Lincoln and Seward are unwilling to offer direct monetary bribes to the Democrats, they authorize agents to quietly go about contacting Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their voting in favor of the amendment.\nWith Confederate envoys ready to meet with Lincoln, he instructs them to be kept out of Washington, as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. At the moment of truth, Thaddeus Stevens decides to moderate his statements about racial equality to help the amendment's chances of passage. A rumor circulates that there are Confederate representatives in Washington ready to discuss peace, prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote on the amendment. Lincoln explicitly denies that such envoys are in or will be in the city \u00e2\u0080\u0094 technically a truthful statement, since he had ordered them to be kept away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the vote proceeds, narrowly passing by a margin of two votes.\nWhen Lincoln subsequently meets with the Confederates, he tells them that slavery cannot be restored as the North is united for ratification of the amendment, and that several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. On April 3, Lincoln visits the battlefield at Petersburg, Virginia, where he exchanges a few words with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant. Six days later, Grant receives General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.\nOn April 14, Lincoln is in a meeting with members of his cabinet, discussing possible future measures to enfranchise blacks when he is reminded that First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln is waiting to take them to their evening at Ford's Theatre. That night, while Lincoln's son Tad is watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp at Grover's Theatre, the manager suddenly stops the play and announces that the President has been shot, to the audience's shock and Tad's distress. The next morning at the Petersen House, Lincoln dies; Secretary of War Edwin Stanton declares, \"Now he belongs to the ages\".

They are trained to be ruthless obedient killers, and all those considered to be physically or mentally unworthy are executed. The survivors are turned into impassive dedicated fighting machines with no exposure to or understanding of the outside world.\nIn 2035, at the age of 39, Sgt. Todd 3465 is a hardened veteran and the best soldier of the original 1996 infants, but his unit is challenged for replacement by a superior unit. Colonel Mekum, leader of the original project, introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except complete aggression.\nCaptain Church, the commander of Todd's unit, insists on testing the new soldiers' abilities against his proven older ones. A new soldier, Caine 607, easily defeats three of the original soldiers, but Todd gouges out Caine's eye before he seemingly dies when he falls from a great height; the body of a dead soldier actually cushioned his fall, and he is simply stunned and knocked unconscious. Mekum orders their bodies disposed of like garbage, declaring them obsolete, while the remaining older soldiers are demoted to menial unarmed support roles.\nDumped on Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet, Todd limps toward a colony whose residents crash-landed there years earlier; as they were believed dead, no rescue missions have been attempted. Todd is sheltered by Mace and his wife Sandra. Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extremely rigid impassive conditioning and their conflict-free lives. Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized by a snakebite as an infant, and watches upon the happy loving family with yearning in his eyes. When the child silently looks to him for a defense against a coiled snake, Todd refuses, demanding that Nathan face it down and strike back to protect himself. Nathan's parents intervene and disapprove of the lesson, unsure of how to deal with the silent soldier. Todd becomes disoriented by exposure to peaceful civilian life and soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time killing civilians and battling other soldiers. To make matters worse, he mistakes one of the colonists for an enemy when the fellow surprises him, nearly killing him. Fearful, the colonists expel Todd from the community. Apparently rejected by every society he has known, the military and the refugee civilians, Todd shows strong emotion for the first time after being expelled. Overcome by loss, he quietly cries. A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by a snake while they sleep, but they are saved by Nathan's use of Todd's aggressive defensive technique to protect them. Now understanding the value of Todd's lesson, they seek him to reintegrate him into the community, regardless of the opposition of the others who fear him.\nThe new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet, and, since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides to use the colonists' community as the target in a training exercise. Just after Mace finds Todd, apologizes and invites him back, the soldiers spot Mace and kill him. Though out-manned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad. Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using guerrilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, whom he defeats in vicious hand-to-hand combat by clever tactics rather than mere physical prowess.\nPanicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet. He then orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind. When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades silently side with him over the army that has discarded them. They take over the ship, leaving Mekum and his supportive aides on the planet while they evacuate the remaining colonists. In an attempt to disarm the nuclear device, Mekum accidentally sets it off, killing him and his aides. Todd pilots the ship from Arcadia just ahead of the shockwave and sets course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination. When Nathan enters the control room and reaches for Todd, he then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Orphans are chosen for a new military program"}], "question": "What happens in 1996?", "id": "6980d4fa658789997b0eddc18fb2507d0577fa8e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are killed"}], "question": "What happens to the children that can not take the training?", "id": "6980d4fa658789997b0eddc18fb2507d0577fa8e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sgt Todd 3465"}], "question": "What character is followed first?", "id": "6980d4fa658789997b0eddc18fb2507d0577fa8e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They created genetically enhanced new soilders.

The Scottish local community mobilises to uncover and thwart the conspiracy against her, and to defend the neutrality of Scotland against the Russian revolutionary struggle. A plot based on espionage and covert violence is set against the seemingly tranquil Scottish rural backdrop, a narrative device commonly found in Buchan\u2019s novels. He uses this notably in The Thirty Nine Steps. The novel contrasts the domestic characters, heroes and villains, with their more alien Russian counterparts. Huntingtower is characteristic of Buchan\u2019s novels, particularly in its class-based paternalism; its xenophobic prejudices, which are mitigated by instinctive humanity and dry humour; and its shrewd common-sense understanding of personality and motivation. We see Buchan's class based paternalism in the attitudes of various characters, from Saskia's insistence on pointing out the former status of her Russian family to Phemie Morran's lifelong loyalty to the extinct Kennedy family, to whom she was once a domestic servant. Heritage and McCunn instantly react to the first foreign resident of Huntingtower, a man called Leon, whose unwholesome appearance Buchan describes with relish:\n\"He was a sturdy fellow in a suit of blackclothes which had not been made for him. He might have been a butler en deshabille, but for the presence of a pair of field boots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers. The curious thing about him was his face, which was decorated with features so tiny as to give the impression of a monstrous child. Each in itself was well enough formed, but eyes, nose, mouth, chin were of smallness curiously out of proportion to the head and body. Such an anomaly might have been redeemed by the expression; good-humour would have invested it with an air of agreeable farce. But there was no friendliness in the man\u2019s face. It was set like a judge\u2019s in a stony impassiveness.\" Huntingtower chapter three.\nThe moment when Dickson McCunn relinquishes his timid wish to remain strictly inside the law and decides to take a hand against the foreign conspirators gives an ironic insight into McCunn's social conditioning, whereby the veranda is an acceptable way to break into a house and the coal hole is unacceptable.\n\"They both looked at Dickson, and Dickson, scarlet in the face, looked back at them. He had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to Auchenlochan intolerable. Once again he was at the parting of the ways, and once more caprice determined his decision. That the coal-hole was out of the question had worked a change in his views, Somehow it seemed to him less burglarious to enter by a veranda. He felt very frightened but for the moment quite resolute. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d he said.\" Huntingtower chapter five.\nIn this novel Buchan creates characters across a broad spectrum of Scottish social classes and backgrounds, and while no one except McCunn is presented in great depth, we are given sharp and revealing character sketches of other key characters. Heritage\u2019s single handed defence of the actual tower and his attempt to free-climb away from the burning building show not only his actions but his reasons and thinking, why he is doing what he is doing. Wee Jaikie's inner life is only hinted at occasionally, but his dogged perseverance and resourcefulness come through at several moments when his interventions are important. In the final resolution of the story, a band of adventurers ranging from an injured laird and his faithful menservants to a group of semi-outcast street urchins from Glasgow have bonded and have combined to fight for a common purpose, out of belief in right and wrong, and allegiance to Scotland.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Russian noblewoman"}], "question": "Who is

commercials, a job not in keeping with his one-time aspiration to be a jazz composer and pianist. His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who collects statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him to ask questions.\nHarvey is upset to discover his ex-wife Jean rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States but failed to include him. At the rehearsal dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is systematically being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian and is treated as a mere guest. They fake their politeness towards him and make him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. When Harvey tells Susan, with whom he has shared a strained relationship since his divorce, that he will be attending the ceremony but not the subsequent reception because he needs to return to the States for an important meeting, she informs him she has asked her stepfather Brian to give her away.\nMeanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. When she returns to the table after taking yet another call from her neurotic mother Maggie, who is certain her Polish neighbor is burying bodies in a shed in his yard, she discovers her date has invited friends to join them. Feeling unwanted and excluded from the conversation, she eventually excuses herself and goes home.\nThe following morning Harvey attends the wedding but quickly leaves for the airport without congratulating the married couple. But due to heavy traffic delays he misses his flight at Heathrow. When he calls his boss Marvin to advise him he will be returning a day later than planned, he is fired. Determined to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest conversation about what they're feeling and thinking.\nHarvey follows Kate to the Heathrow Express and, upon arrival at Paddington station, asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the South Bank. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to meet her after class. As they stroll along the River Thames, Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. When Kate insists she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the Grosvenor House Hotel, where they are welcomed coolly by Susan and get two places at the children's table. When the father of the bride is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak until Harvey interrupts. He then delivers an eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate.\nImmediately following the first dance of the bride and groom, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter for the Father-Daughter Dance. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the floor for the rumba, tango and other dances, with Harvey enjoying himself on the dance floor, alone. Kate is left at the table, once again in the same position as when she was on her blind date. Her smile becomes more strained as she looks about and sees herself alone at the table in a room of strangers for several dances, Harvey having apparently forgotten she was there. When she surmises he will not be coming to ask her to dance, her smile disappears and she quietly leaves the room and stands in front of the elevator, preparing to leave.\nHarvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side annex with a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions for her. She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her. He asks her to return to the reception to dance and stay with him. She smiles and agrees.\nFollowing the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk until dawn. They exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon. At his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations and is rushed to the hospital, where he receives a call from Marvin who, having discovered his employee is more indispensable than he thought, urges him to return to work as soon as possible. Harvey decides he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks her down at her writing class and reveals why he missed their rendezvous. Overcautious about romance because of so many past disappointments, Kate initially resists his suggestion that they see what the future might bring them, but finally agrees to give things a chance.\nAs they slowly stroll away, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence \"...is in transition.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He writes jingles for television commercials."}], "question": "What is Harvey Shine's profession?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To attend his daughter Susan's wedding."}], "question": "Why does Harvey Shine travel to London?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is taking statics from passengers as the go through the terminals."}], "question": "What is Kate Walker doing in the airport when Harvey Shine initially meets her?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She excludes him."}], "question": "How does Harvey's ex-wife Jean treat him?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jean's new husband."}], "question": "Who is Brian?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Here stepfather Brian."}], "question": "Who does Susan ask to give her away at the wedding?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because of heavy traffic."}], "question": "Why does Harvey miss  his fligh at Heathrow after he leaves Susan's wedding?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He fires Harvey."}], "question": "What does Marvin do when Harvey tells him he will be late returning to work?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Kate Walker."}], "question": "Who accompanies Harvey to Susan's wedding reception?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A writing class."}], "question": "What type of class is Kate taking?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "London"}], "question": "Where was Jean's daughter's wedding being held?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "be a jazz composer and pianist"}], "question": "What type of work did Susan's father really want to do?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "her mother's new husband, Brian"}], "question": "Which person was asked to walk Harvey's daughter down the isle?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "like a guest"}], "question": "How was Jean's ex-husband treated in London?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "after a phone call with her mother"}], "question": "When did Kate leave the blind date she was on at the restaurant?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Maggie, Kate's mother"}], "question": "Who thinks someone has bodies buried in their backyard?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he couldn't make an important meeting a work because he missed is flight"}], "question": "Why was Harvey fired?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "his father of the bride speech at her reception"}], "question": "What changed Susan's attitude towards her father?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By playing one of his jazz compositions"}], "question": "How did Harvey stop Kate just before she left the wedding reception?", "id": "6aa4c6be53eff0024e5c84f99ac94cddff4eb8f0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Be a jazz composer and pianist.

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.\nTravis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers Travis to illegal gun dealer Easy Andy, from whom he buys a number of handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons and constructs a sleeve gun to hide and then quickly deploy a gun from his sleeve. One night, Travis enters a convenience store moments before an attempted armed robbery and he shoots and kills the robber. The shop owner takes responsibility for the shooting, taking Travis' handgun. On another night, teenage prostitute Iris enters Travis's cab, attempting to escape her pimp Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins. Sport drags Iris from the cab and throws Travis a crumpled twenty-dollar bill, which continually reminds him of her and the corruption that surrounds him. Some time later, Travis hires Iris, but instead of having sex with her, attempts to dissuade her from continuing in prostitution. He fails to completely turn her from her course, but she does agree to meet with him for breakfast the next day. Travis leaves a letter to Iris at his apartment saying he will soon be dead, with money for her to return home.\nAfter shaving his head into a mohawk, Travis attends a public rally, where he plans to assassinate Senator Palantine, but Secret Service agents notice him with his hand in his coat and chase him. He flees and later goes to the East Village to invade Sport's brothel. A violent gunfight ensues and Travis kills Sport, a bouncer, and a mafioso. Travis is severely injured with multiple gunshot wounds. Iris witnesses the fight and is hysterical with fear, pleading with Travis to stop the killing. After the gunfight, Travis attempts suicide, but has run out of ammunition and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index finger against his temple gesturing the act of shooting himself.\nTravis, after having recovered from his wounds and returning to work, receives a letter from Iris' father thanking him for saving her life and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. Later, he reconciles with Betsy after dropping her off at home in his cab. When she tries to pay her fare, Travis simply smiles at her and drives away.

A young New Yorker, rich, of course, hears from his window on a night of fog and mist a woman's voice singing divinely. He falls in love with it head over heels and he falls downstairs in about the same way, he is such a hurry to see the singer. But by the time her reaches the street, lo! she has vanished, and only a policeman remains. Late on, this young, adventurous Mr. Hillard again meets the young, adventurous singer under most mystifying circumstances. They dine together, but she comes in mask. What the voice has begun, the masks puts the finishing touches to. From then on Hillard is full forty fathoms deep in love and curiosity. Then the scene shifts to Italy, with the shifting fortunes of an American comic opera company, stranded at Venice. The beautiful singer becomes the prima donna of this company. The soubrette is one Kitty Killigrew, and around her flourishes a most enticing, exciting and enlivening subplot. She dances her way straight into your heart. Amusing things happen at Venice. Thrilling things happen at Monte Carlo. At Florence the climax is reached, and it makes you fairly gasp with its intense interest. At Bellaggio, the loveliest of lovely spots in the land of love, the curtain goes down on happy lovers.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He hears a woman's beautiful singing."}], "question": "What does Hillard hear through his window?", "id": "6dede499df79827ea44d634f07b998b90ee4a05d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He falls down the stairs.

Meanwhile, his guardian and son go to a socialist meeting. Indeed, his son Norman becomes infatuated with Barbara Bozenta, a socialist figure, and hosts a socialist meeting at Col. Worth's country house near Berkeley on July 4, American Independence Day. The meeting is canceled when Norman attempts to put up the Red Flag as opposed to the American flag.\nCol. Worth buys the island of Ventura for his son Norman. Located off the coast of Santa Barbara, it is meant for Norman to establish a socialist commune there. When his socialist friends fail to work, law and order needs to be restored. However, Comrades Herman and Catherine Wolf take over as heads of the commune, and sentence Norman to work in the stables, under the threat of the lash. Productivity falls as workers know they must work nine hours a day, and thus work slowly. When Norman finds a way to find gold on the beach, the device is stolen by Wolf. Wolf's wife Catherine then leaves for Santa Barbara, deeming family life to be too capitalistic.\nEventually, Norman reaches out to his father and to the Governor of California, who liberate the island.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive, the duo drug Northup and conspire to deliver him to a slave pen. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with others who have been detained against their will. A slave trader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him and another slave Eliza to plantation owner William Ford. Due to tension between Northup and another plantation worker, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but to no avail.\nSome time later, an outbreak of cotton worm befalls Epps' plantation. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts to use the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York state. Armsby agrees to deliver the letter, and accepts Northup's saved money in return, but later betrays him to Epps. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and avoids punishment.\nNorthup begins working on the construction of a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Patsy sneaks off to Mistress Shaw's house to get some soap to clean herself. Epps calls her a liar and ties her to post to prepare her for a whipping. Epps hands the whip to Northup and forces him to whip Patsy. Northup reluctantly begins to whip her but Epps rips the whip out of Northup's hands and unleashes a brutal whipping on Patsy. Her back is shredded and her flesh is torn apart. Later Northup confides his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, Northup is called over by the local sheriff, who arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving.\nAfter being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is restored to freedom and returned to his family. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave, his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A free American man working as a

Christian (Myra Carter), whose husband has recently died. While clearing out her late husband's safe, she and Longdale found an 8mm film which appears to depict a real murder of a girl, but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain.\nAfter looking through missing persons files, Tom discovers that the girl is Mary Ann Mathews (Jenny Powell), and visits her mother, Janet Mathews (Amy Morton). While searching the house with her permission, he finds Mary Ann's diary, in which she says that she went to Hollywood to become a film star. He asks Mrs. Mathews whether she wants to know the truth, even if it is a horrible truth. She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter, so after reading the diary and a note left for her mother inside of it, he leaves it for her and then leaves.\nIn Hollywood, with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), Tom penetrates the underworld of illegal pornography. Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) leads them to director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as \"Machine\" (Chris Bauer). To gain more evidence, Tom pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore bondage film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine. Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City.\nAt the meeting, attorney Longdale appears and explains that Christian had contracted him to procure a snuff film. Longdale says that he told Velvet that Tom might come looking for them. Realizing that the snuff film was authentic, the private eye knows he is at risk. Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max, whom they abducted to force Tom to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film. Once he delivers it, but before he turns it over, they kill Max and beat Tom and then burn the film. As they are about to kill Tom, he tells them that Christian had paid $1 million for the film and that the reason Christian wanted the film made was for the simple reason that he had enough money to make it possible. Unbeknownst to them previously Velvet, Poole, and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Tom wounds Machine and escapes.\nHe calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Tom is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Tom: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, \"Try to forget us.\"\nTom decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved. Tracking down Eddie, Tom takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him. Eddie shows no remorse for his role in the murder and taunts Tom for being unable to go through with it. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her the truth about her daughter's fate and asks a devastated Janet for her permission to punish those responsible, to which she says yes. With that, he returns and pistol whips Eddie to death. After burning his body and the pornography from his car, Tom traces Machine and attacks him at his home. Tom unmasks him, revealing a bald, bespectacled man named George. He says, \"What did you expect? A monster?\" George goes on to tell Tom that he has no ulterior motive for his sadistic actions; he does them simply because he enjoys it. They struggle, and Tom kills him.\nAfter returning to his family, Tom receives a letter from Mrs. Mathews, thanking him for killing the men responsible and suggesting he and she were the only ones to care about Mary Ann.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dino Velvet."}], "question": "What is the name of the director Tom hires?", "id": "6ed5d860df4edd3d32f1aca52ec369f0d21039a0"},

in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda terrorists set off a bomb, killing Americans and Saudis. While one team hijacks a car and shoots residents, a suicide bomber ( wearing a fake police uniform ) blows himself up, killing everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman) of the Saudi State Police kills several of the terrorists. The FBI Legal Attach\u0102\u0160 in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Fran Manner (Kyle Chandler), calls his US colleague, Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx), to advise him about the attack. Manner is discussing the situation with DSS Regional Security Officer Special Agent Rex Bura when an ambulance full of explosives is detonated killing Manner, Bura and many others.\nAt FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack. Although the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department hinder FBI efforts to investigate the attack, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team into Saudi Arabia. Fleury gathers Special Agent Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), a forensic examiner, FBI analyst Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), an intelligence analyst, and Special Agent Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), a bomb technician, go to Saudi Arabia. On arrival they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), the commander of the Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound. The investigation is being run by General Al Abdulmalik (Mahmoud Said) of the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG), who does not give Fleury and his team permission to investigate.\nThe FBI team is invited to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled (Omar Berdouni) for a dinner. While at the palace, Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation. With this change in leadership, the Americans are allowed hands-on access to the crime scene. While searching for evidence, Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman) and Sykes discover the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance. Fleury learns the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. Colonel al-Ghazi orders a SWAT team to raid a house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. Following the raid, the team discovers clues, including photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh. Soon afterward, the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt (Jeremy Piven) notifies Fleury and his team that they have been ordered to return to the United States.\nOn their way to King Khalid International Airport, their convoy is attacked and incapacitated. Leavitt is dragged out of the wrecked car and kidnapped by terrorists who flee while Fleury manages to wound one attacker. Al-Ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth SUV and the other car holding Leavitt into the dangerous Al-Suwaidi neighborhood of Riyadh. As they pull up, a gunman launches rocket-propelled grenades at them and a fierce firefight starts. FBI analyst Leavitt is tied up inside a complex.\nWhile Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video for Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandson hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.\nAt al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham meet his family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the U.S., where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace (Richard Jenkins) for their outstanding work. Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had whispered to her to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own daughter what his grandfather whispered to her as he was dying. The granddaughter tells her mother, \"Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all,\" a similar line Fleury whispered to Mayes, implying that this is a never-ending, vicious cycle.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the Saudi

"paragraphs": [{"context": " The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, in Victorian England, and identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing, and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it. Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants, but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.\nMeanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.\nOverwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey. After promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Richmond, Surrey"}], "question": "Where does the Time Traveller live?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Eloi"}], "question": "Who are the small, elegant, childlike adults?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Morlocks"}], "question": "Who are the ape-like troglodytes that live in the underground cave?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Eloi"}], "question": "What do the Morlocks eat?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Weena"}], "question": "Who does the Time Traveller save from drowning?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Sphinx"}], "question": "What does the structure where the Time Machine look like?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The levers"}], "question": "What did the Time Traveller take from the time machine to stop anyone from using it?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a forest fire"}], "question": "How did Weena die?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The two strange white flowers, Weena put in his pocket."}], "question": "What does the Time Traveller show as proof of his journey?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "3 hours"}], "question": "How long did it take the Time Traveller to return from his first trip?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A time machine"}], "question": "What does the traveler reveal he has built?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Eloi"}], "question": "What society does the Time traveller meet in AD 802701?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His time machine"}], "question": "What does the traveller find missing upon his return to the site?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Morlocks"}], "question": "Who approaches the traveller in the dark?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Morlocks"}], "question": "Who feeds on the Eloi?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Weena"}], "question": "Who does Traveller save from drowning?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Forest Fire"}], "question": "What kills Weena?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The earth"}], "question": "What does the Traveller see freezing ?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Flowers"}], "question": "What had weena put in his pocket?", "id": "72ddeff1fe6bb9841d1c1da4b3031001bf6b1f58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Furgivorous diet."}], "question": "What kind of diet do the Eloi have?

After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because she violated the terms of her work visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton, to marry her. She reminds Andrew that if she's deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, and he'll be set back in his dream to become an editor. Mr. Gilbertson, a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret agrees.\nThe couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, Andrew's hometown, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace and grandmother Annie a.k.a. \"Gammy\". During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe, who is angry about Andrew's dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude, Andrew's ex-girlfriend.\nThe next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone. Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.\nThe next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she \"passes away\". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Editor in chief of book publishing company"}], "question": "What is Margaret Tate's job?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Andrew Paxton"}], "question": "Who does Magaret Tate ask to marry her to avoid deportation?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Gilbertson"}], "question": "What U.S. immigration agent thinks Tate is commiting fraud?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Publish Paxton's book and make him an editor"}], "question": "What does Margaret Tate agree to if Andrew Paxton marries her?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sitka, Alaska"}], "question": "What is Paxton's hometown?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grace"}], "question": "Who is Paxton's mother?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gertrude"}], "question": "Who is Paxton's ex-girldfriend?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gertrude didn't want to leave Sitka to go to New York with Paxton"}], "question": "Why didn't Gertrude marry Paxton?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They died"}], "question": "What happened to Margaret's parents when she was 16 years old?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a heart attack"}], "question": "What did Annie fake to cause Margaret and Andrew to make up?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Executive editor in chief"}], "question": "What job does Margaret hold?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is about to be deported back to Canada"}], "question": "Why does she talk Andrew, her assistant, into marrying her?", "id": "73b739350f4657b6831e951b890b0894a5886607"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To meet Andrew's family"}], "question": "Why does Andrew and Margaret go to Sitka, Alaska?

An army of men and elves battle Sauron\u2019s forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of Sauron's finger, thereby temporarily destroying his physical shape, and decides to take care of the Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.\nSixty years on, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals he intends on leaving the Shire for one last adventure and leaves his inheritance to his nephew Frodo, including the Ring. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovering its true identity and warns Frodo. Learning Gollum was tortured by Orcs and told them that Bilbo took the Ring, Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard, meeting fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns he is in league with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in Bree where they are meant to meet Gandalf, but are instead aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalf's who escorts them to Rivendell.\nThe Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, one stabbing Frodo with a morgul blade. Arwen, an elf and Strider\u2019s lover, comes to Frodo\u2019s aid and successfully takes him to Rivendell where he is healed, meeting Gandalf who escaped Saruman on the back of a giant eagle. Arwen\u2019s father, Lord Elrond, holds a council, deciding that the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf Legolas, dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur\u2019s heir and rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off but Saruman\u2019s magic forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria.\nThe Fellowship find the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called the Balrog. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but its fiery whip drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now led by Aragorn, reach Lothl\u00f3rien, home to elves Galadriel and Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and one of his friends will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai to track and kill the Fellowship save Frodo.\nThe Fellowship leave Lothl\u00f3rien by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off, confronted by Boromir who tries to take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The other members fight off the Uruk-hai, but Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain. Aragorn helps Boromir die peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep his promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry and Pippin.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "FRODO"}], "question": "WHO IS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST IN THIS STORY?", "id": "750ec3a9ab4879f2593fb1baed81e6b449a5c755"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "SAM"}], "question": "WHO IS FRODO'S MAIN TRAVELING COMPANION?", "id": "750ec3a9ab4879f2593fb1baed81e6b449a5c755"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THE HOBBITS"}], "question": "WHO ARE AMBUSHED BY THE RINGWRAITHS?", "id": "750ec3a9ab4879f2593fb1baed81e6b449a5c755"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "FRODO"}], "question": "WHO OFFERS TO TAKE THE RING TO MT.

Except for a few short excursuses (notably 6.54-58 on the Tyrant Slayers), the remainder of the History (books 2 through 8) rigidly maintains its focus on the Peloponnesian War to the exclusion of other topics.\nWhile the History concentrates on the military aspects of the Peloponnesian War, it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes closely related to the war. It specifically discusses in several passages the socially and culturally degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. The History is especially concerned with the lawlessness and atrocities committed by Greek citizens to each other in the name of one side or another in the war. Some events depicted in the History, such as the Melian dialogue, describe early instances of realpolitik or power politics.\nThe History is preoccupied with the interplay of justice and power in political and military decision-making. Thucydides' presentation is decidedly ambivalent on this theme. While the History seems to suggest that considerations of justice are artificial and necessarily capitulate to power, it sometimes also shows a significant degree of empathy with those who suffer from the exigencies of the war.\nFor the most part, the History does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of Greece.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The military aspects

\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 [p\u00e9nte], \u2018five\u2019; y \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 [h\u00eam\u00e9ra], \u2018day\u2019 because is structured around a fantastic frame story, in which fifty stories are related over the course of five days, rather than the ten of the Decameron compendium of Tuscany (1353). The frame story is that of a cursed, melancholy princess named Zoza (\"mud\" or \"slime\" in Neapolitan, but also used as a term of endearment). She cannot laugh, no matter what her father does to amuse her, so he sets up a fountain of oil by the door, thinking people slipping in the oil would make her laugh. An old woman tried to gather oil, a page boy broke her jug, and the old woman grew so angry that she danced about, and Zoza laughed at her. The old woman cursed her to marry only the prince of Round-Field, whom she could only wake by filling a pitcher with tears in three days. With some aid from fairies, who also give her gifts, Zoza found the prince and the pitcher, and nearly filled the pitcher when she fell asleep. A Moorish slave steals it, finishes filling it, and claims the prince.\nThis frame story in itself is a fairy tale, combining motifs that will appear in other stories: the princess who cannot laugh in The Magic Swan, Golden Goose, and The Princess Who Never Smiled; the curse to marry only one hard-to-find person, in Snow-White-Fire-Red and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa; and the heroine falling asleep while trying to save the hero, and then losing him because of trickery in The Sleeping Prince and Nourie Hadig.\nThe now-pregnant slave-queen demands (at the impetus of Zoza's fairy gifts) that her husband tell her stories, or else she would crush the unborn child. The husband hires ten female storytellers to keep her amused; disguised among them is Zoza. Each tells five stories, most of which are more suitable to courtly, rather than juvenile, audiences. The Moorish woman's treachery is revealed in the final story (related, suitably, by Zoza), and she is buried, pregnant, up to her neck in the ground and left to die. Zoza and the Prince live happily ever after.\nMany of these fairy tales are the oldest known variants in existence.\nThe fairy tales are:\nThe First Day\n\"The Tale of the Ogre\"\n\"The

"paragraphs": [{"context": " In a Prologue, the characters in the drama are introduced by an \u2018Animal Tamer\u2019 as if they are creatures in a travelling circus. Lulu herself is described as \u201cthe true animal, the wild, beautiful animal\u201d and the \u201cprimal form of woman\u201d.\nWhen the action of the play starts, Lulu has been rescued by the rich newspaper publisher Dr Sch\u00f6n from a life on the streets with her alleged father, the petty criminal Schigolch. Dr Sch\u00f6n has taken Lulu under his wing, educated her and made her his lover. Wishing however to make a more socially advantageous match for himself, he has married her off to the medic Dr Goll.\nIn the first Act Dr Goll has brought Lulu to have her portrait painted by Schwarz. Left alone with him, Lulu seduces the painter. When Dr Goll returns to confront them, he collapses with a fatal heart attack.\nIn Act Two, Lulu has married the painter Schwarz, who, with Sch\u00f6n\u2019s assistance, has now achieved fame and wealth. She remains Sch\u00f6n\u2019s mistress, however. Wishing to be rid of her ahead of his forthcoming marriage to a society belle, Charlotte von Zarnikow, Sch\u00f6n informs Schwarz about her dissolute past. Schwarz is shocked to the core and \u201cguillotines\u201d himself with his razor.\nIn Act Three Lulu appears as a dancer in a revue, her new career promoted by Sch\u00f6n\u2019s son Alwa, who is now also infatuated with her. Dr Sch\u00f6n is forced to admit that he is in her thrall. Lulu forces him to break off his engagement to Charlotte.\nIn Act Four Lulu is now married to Dr Sch\u00f6n but is unfaithful to him with several other men (Schigolch, Alwa, the circus artist Rodrigo Quast and the lesbian Countess Geschwitz). On discovering this, Sch\u00f6n presses a revolver into her hand, urging her to kill herself. Instead, she uses it to shoot Sch\u00f6n, all the while declaring him the only man she has ever loved. She is imprisoned for her crime.\nHer escape from prison with the aid of Countess Geschwitz and subsequent career down to her death at the hands of Jack the Ripper in London are the subject of the sequel, Pandora\u2019s Box. It is now customary in theatre performances to run the two plays together, in abridged form, under the title Lulu.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jack the Ripper"}], "question": "Who was responsible for Lulu's death in London?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Animal tamers"}], "question": "How are the characters initially introuduced as?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr Schon"}], "question": "Who takes Lulu under his wing?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Schwartz"}], "question": "Who paints a portrait of Lulu?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had a heart attack"}], "question": "How did Dr Goll die?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr Schon"}], "question": "Who is Lulu's second husband?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was shocked"}], "question": "How did Schwartz react to learning about Lulu's past?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He wanted her to kill herself"}], "question": "What did Schon want Lulu to do after finding out about her infidelities?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She killed him"}], "question": "What did Lulu end up doing with the revolver given to her by Schon?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Countess Geschwitz"}], "question": "Who helped Lulu to escape from prison?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An Animal Tamer"}], "question": "Who introduces the haracters in the prologue?", "id": "78775713129c757ce928985ab432f2751d7b46af"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr. Goll"}], "question": "Who is the medic Lulu is married off to?

His intelligence, insistence on following regulations, and cold demeanor contribute to his isolation from other officers. He exacerbates this resentment by volunteering to testify in the Bloody Christmas case in exchange for a promotion to Detective Lieutenant. This goes against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), who states that a detective should be willing to shoot a guilty man in the back for the greater good. Exley's ambition is fueled by the murder of his father, killed by an unknown assailant, whom Exley nicknames \"Rollo Tomasi\".\nOfficer Wendell \"Bud\" White (Russell Crowe), whom Exley considers a \"mindless thug\", is a plainclothes officer obsessed with violently punishing woman-beaters. One such incident leads him to confront a former cop named Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks, a driver for Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn). White comes to dislike Exley after White's partner, Dick Stensland, is fired due to Exley's testimony in the Bloody Christmas scandal. White is sought out by Smith for a job in which they harass and beat up out-of-town criminals trying to fill the void left in Los Angeles following the imprisonment of gangster Mickey Cohen for tax evasion. The Nite Owl case, a multiple homicide at a coffee shop, becomes personal after Stensland is found to be one of the victims.\nDetective Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a popular TV police drama series. He is providing Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine, with tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hudgens' magazine. When he becomes involved in Hudgen's scheme to set up actor Matt Reynolds (Simon Baker) in a homosexual tryst with L.A. district attorney Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), and Reynolds is killed as a result, Vincennes becomes determined to find the killer.\nThree African Americans are initially charged with the Nite Owl murders, and later killed in a shootout. Although the Nite Owl crime initially looks like a botched robbery, Exley and White individually investigate it to discover indications of corruption all around them. White recognizes Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts as one of Meeks' escorts which leads him back to Pierce Patchett, operator of Fleur-de-Lis, a call girl service that runs prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble film stars. He begins a relationship with Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute. The body count rises when White searches a storage room under Lefferts' mother's house, and finds the decomposed corpse of Meeks.\nWhen Vincennes approaches Smith with the evidence he has found with Exley, Smith realizes his scheme to take over Mickey Cohen's heroin empire is threatened. Smith shoots Vincennes, who utters \"Rollo Tomasi\" before dying, the origin of which Exley told Vincennes in confidence. Exley's suspicions are aroused when Smith asks him who Rollo Tomasi is. During an interrogation of Hudgens, Smith arranges for White to see photos of Bracken sleeping with Exley, which sends White into a rage. Confident that White has gone after Exley to kill him, Smith kills Hudgens. Exley investigates and discovers Meeks and Stensland used to work closely with Smith. White drives to the police station and begins to fight Exley, but Exley is able to convince White that Smith is corrupt and has set them both up. The two decide to team together to take down Smith. They are able to obtain evidence against Smith by threatening Loew, and later find Patchett murdered. Exley and White realize that Smith himself has been taking over after Cohen, and the killings have been Smith tying up loose ends.\nExley and White are set up with a trap against Smith and his hitmen. After a gunfight that kills all the hitmen, Smith shoots White in the face, but then is forced to surrender to Exley. As police arrive, Exley shoots Smith in the back, killing him. The LAPD cover up Smith's crimes and say he died a hero in the shootout to protect the department's image, and in exchange Exley bargains to also be hailed a hero and receives a medal for his bravery. Upon leaving City Hall, Exley sees Bracken, who tells him she is returning home to Arizona with White, revealing White survived the shooting. Exley and White shake hands and Bracken drives off into the sunset.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He wants to be promoted to Detective Lieutenant."}], "question": "Why does Exley

version of Austen's protagonist Emma Woodhouse. Like Emma, Cher is a well-intentioned but somewhat superficial girl who is attractive, popular and extremely wealthy. A few months shy of her sixteenth birthday, she has risen to the top of the high school social scene. She lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a ferocious $500-an-hour litigator; her mother died from a freak accident during a routine liposuction procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher's best friend is Dionne Davenport, who is also rich, pretty, and hip, and understands what it's like to be envied. Though Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray, Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor on Dionne's part.\nAmong the few people to find fault with Cher is Josh, her socially-conscious stepbrother, who visits her during a break from college. Josh and Cher spar continually but without malice; she mocks his scruffy idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain, and superficial, and says that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two lonely, nerdy, hard-grading teachers, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She achieves her ostensible purpose, to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad report card; but when she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. Cher decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically unhip\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover and initiate her into the mysteries of popularity. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her toward Elton, a popular rich snob.\nHer second matchmaking scheme backfires when Elton rejects Tai and attempts to seduce Cher. When a handsome new student named Christian arrives at their school, Cher takes a shine to him and attempts to secure him as her boyfriend. Eventually, Murray spells it out to her and Dionne that Christian is not interested in her because he is gay.\nDespite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on good terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Cher's \"project\" works too well, and Tai's popularity surpasses her own. The situation reaches crisis stage after Cher fails her driver's test and can't \"renegotiate\" the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confides that she's taken a fancy to Josh and wants Cher to help her \"get\" him. Cher says she doesn't think Josh is right for Tai, and they quarrel. Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\nAfter much soul searching, Cher realizes she is romantically interested in Josh. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's Pismo Beach disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss.\nIn the end, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love; and Cher wins a $200 bet for catching the bouquet at the wedding. She embraces Josh, and they kiss as the film closes.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Josh"}], "question": "What is Cher's stepbrother's name?", "id":

in contact with his former love, Anna Leath, who had previously married another man. Now widowed, she resumes contact with Darrow. Darrow desires to continue the relationship he had with Anna but remains concerned about her commitment to the relationship.\nThe novel begins with Darrow preparing to join Anna in France when he receives a telegram ordering him to wait \"til thirtieth\" because of an \"unexpected obstacle\" - one of many such delays Anna has ordered. Deeply humiliated and disappointed, Darrow boards the boat regardless and runs into the young Sophy Viner, a woman he had previously encountered but never gotten to know thoroughly . Sophy, although down on her luck, is an ambitious aspiring actress determined to start a new life in France. Enthralled, Darrow convinces her to spend a few days with him so he can show her around Paris. During their time spent together, the two enter into a romantic affair.\nMonths later, Darrow meets Anna at her French country chateau at Givr\u0102\u0160. They speak of their future and of Anna's stepson Owen, who wishes to marry a woman of which his grandmother, Dowager Marquise de Chantelle, does not approve. Additionally, Darrow informs Anna of his plans for their future together; he hopes to move to South America together for his job. It is revealed that Anna had hired a governess for her young daughter, Effie. That governess is Sophy Viner.\nSophy, embarrassed by the situation, begs Darrow not to say anything that might jeopardize her employment. Darrow tries to convince Sophy not to marry Owen, and Sophy accuses him of jealousy. Darrow admits to Anna that he knew Sophy already. Anna quizzes him about Sophy, out of concern for Owen, who is engaged to Sophy. Darrow agrees with the Marquise that the union would not be wise.\nThe Dowager Marquise requests that an old family friend, Adelaide Painter, talk some sense into the family. However, when Adelaide supports the union, the Marquise concedes to her grandson. The road is clear for Owen and Sophy to marry, which also frees the path for Darrow and Anna.\nSophy unexpectedly breaks off the engagement to Owen. Owen becomes suspicious of Darrow's influence over Sophy. The main characters then attempt to figure out what happened by interrogating each other. This part of the novel shows an increase in dialogue, and an unusually high rate of dialogue for Wharton's novels.\nSophy eventually reveals to Darrow that she has loved him since Paris. The affair between Darrow and Sophy is revealed to Anna. Darrow attempts to explain that the affair was short lived, but Anna cannot live with the knowledge and becomes convinced that the revelation destroyed any potential for a future relationship.\nDespite the fact that Anna believes herself to be well matched with Darrow, she is unable to overcome her jealousy of Sophy. She becomes obsessed with imagining the time they spent together.\nOwen leaves for Spain. Sophy is reemployed by Mrs. Murrett, her previous employer, and moves to India. Anna encounters Sophy's large, slovenly sister and her lover, which gives Anna the perspective that Sophy is not as much of a fallen woman as she originally thought.

[{"context": " In 1935, Indiana Jones narrowly escapes the clutches of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai in the Republic of China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While the three of them sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a desolate village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by the Hindu god Shiva and enlist their help to retrieve the sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\nThe trio receive a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young Maharajah, Zalim Singh. Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. They discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\nThe trio eventually reach an underground temple where the Thugs worship the Hindu goddess Kali with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial fire pit burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their evil, bloodthirsty high priest Mola Ram are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones, which they hope will allow them to rule the world. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the \"Blood of Kali\", which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, also a Thuggee worshiper, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also forcibly entranced by the \"Blood of Kali,\" attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer. The Maharajah then tells Shorty how to get out of the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones, the village children escape.\nAfter a mine cart chase to escape the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving everyone to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning him. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below, where he is devoured by a Mugger crocodile. The Thugs then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen from Pankot arrive, having been summoned by the palace Maharajah. In the ensuing firefight, many of the Thuggee archers are killed and the remainder are surrounded and captured. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return victoriously to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He escapes on a plane that is owned by the very person he is trying to escape."}], "question": "What means of transportation does Indiana Jones use to escape Shanghai?", "id": "7d64400e2b3306fa27919b8d155ad87bd7d260c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He parachutes out of the plane.

Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a high-court judge who had spent his first eighteen years in India, abruptly decides to retire and return there. Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy) seek a retirement they can afford, having lost most of their savings through investing in their daughter's internet business. Muriel (Maggie Smith), a retired housekeeper prejudiced against Indians, needs a hip replacement operation which can be done far more quickly and inexpensively in India. Madge (Celia Imrie) is hunting for another husband, and Norman (Ronald Pickup), an aging Lothario, is trying to recapture his youth. They each decide on a retirement hotel in India, based on pictures on its website.\nWhen the group arrives at the picturesque hotel, they find an energetic young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) but a dilapidated facility, not yet what he had promised. Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her xenophobia, starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her good service. Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval. Madge joins the Viceroy Club seeking a spouse, where she is surprised to find Norman. She introduces him to Carol (Diana Hardcastle). He admits he is lonely and seeking a companion, and the two begin an affair.\nGraham confides in Evelyn that he is trying to find the Indian lover he was forced to abandon as a youth. Social-climber Jean is attracted to Graham, and makes a rare excursion to follow him, but is humiliated when he explains he is gay. Graham reunites with his former lover, who is in an arranged marriage of mutual trust and respect. Reconciled, the Englishman dies of an existing heart condition. Evelyn and Douglas grow increasingly close, angering his wife, which results in an outburst from Douglas denouncing this marriage. Muriel reveals that she was once housekeeper to a family who had her train her younger replacement and now, having been forced out of the home and into retirement, she feels that she has lost any purpose in her life.\nSonny's more successful brothers each own a third of the hotel and plan to demolish it. His mother (Lillete Dubey) agrees and wants him to return to Delhi for an arranged marriage. Jean and Douglas prepare to return to England after money is found through their daughter's company. Jean eagerly awaits returning to England, but Douglas is more hesitant. Now that the hotel is closing against Sonny's wishes and pleas, Madge prepares to return to England, and Norman agrees to move in with Carol. Madge, after encouragement from Carol and Muriel, decides to keep searching for another husband.\nSonny, encouraged by Evelyn, finally tells Sunaina that he loves her. He confronts his mother, who first forbids the match but then is persuaded by Young Wasim, who speaks no English. He explains that he once knew another man who wanted to marry a smart beautiful woman against his family's wishes. Sonny's mother interprets for Young Wasim, realizing he is talking about her, and she finally gives the couple her blessing. She asks Sunaina to take good care of her \"favourite son\". Before the remaining guests can leave, Muriel reveals that her experience running the family's household gave her the knowledge how to balance a budget and that the hotel can make a profit. She approaches Sonny's investor privately and then invites him to visit the hotel to discuss matters with Sonny. The investor agrees to fund Sonny's plans for renovation so long as Muriel stays on as an assistant manager.\nAll the guests agree to stay \u00e2\u0080\u0094 except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, they decide to return home but on the way to the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A rickshaw driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks when she'll be back. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sonny."}], "question": "Who is the manager of the

set in England in the 1800s. The lead character is Capt. James Wynnegate. His older cousin, heir Henry Wynnegate, Earl of Kerhill, steals from the family trust fund and speculates heavily. Henry loses the fortune, causing them to default on a commitment to an orphans' home.\nCapt. Wynnegate is in love with Henry's wife, Diana. She does not love her husband and returns the affection of the captain. As the money has been lost, Capt. Wynnegate agrees to leave England and take the blame (see remittance man). He is then accused of being a thief, which allows Henry to avoid suspicion and protects the name and the reputation of his wife.\nHe goes to the Wild West of Montana, where he buys the Red Butte Ranch and makes a name for himself under the alias Jim Carson. In the second act, several years later, Henry and Diana show up. The bad man, Cash Hawkins, is about to shoot Jim when the Ute Indian maiden, Nat-u-ritch, shoots Hawkins from the sidelines and saves Jim's life.\nNat-u-ritch, who is the daughter of Chief Tab-y-wana, rescues Jim several more times, it is revealed through exposition in the third act. They fall in love and have a son, Little Hal. Jim marries Nat-u-ritch. The marriage between a white man in his social position and an Indian woman is deemed scandalous.\nBy the fourth act, more time has passed and Diana comes West again with news that Henry has died. The English solicitor shows up and persuades Jim that Hal should be taken to England and raised as the heir to the large Wynnegate estate. Jim agrees to send the boy away.\nApparently, Jim and his social group believe it is his right to take the child away from his mother. Nat-u-ritch's father, Chief Tab-y-wana's resolve is not much different. At the first sign of disobedience the chief voices his sentiment where a woman is concerned. \"If she will not obey, beat her. If she disobeys again, kill her.\"\nKnowing that she is going to lose her son, and hearing that she will be arrested for killing Hawkins, Nat-u-ritch commits suicide. Now Jim is free to be with his English woman. The play concludes with the Indian chief standing stoically erect with the pathetically limp figure of the little mother squaw, his daughter, lying across his outstretched arms, the reversal of the usual Pieta.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The family trust fund."}], "question": "Where did Henry Wynnegate steal from?", "id": "7e7ade00a17d1645761336bc492e7000c60d38ac"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diana, his older cousin's wife."}], "question": "Who is Capt.

African Development Project, Dr. Homer Crawford resigns his post as leader of the Sahara Division team to become El Hassan, the liberator and would-be tyrant of North Africa. Threatened with arrest, Crawford and his followers hide in the Sahara erg. They intercept news that the Arab Union has occupied Tamanrasset, ostensibly to protect the region against El Hassan rioters. Crawford decides to recapture Tamanrasset and use its communications system to proclaim his regime. To do so, he sends his followers to organize troops from nearby regions: the Teda from the east, the Chaambra from the north, the Sudanese from the south, and the Nemadi, Moors, and Rifs from the West. Crawford, Isobel Cunningham, and Cliff Jackson will establish the movement's headquarters in Tuareg country. They are all to rendezvous at Tamanrasset in two weeks.\nCrawford wins the loyalty of the Tuareg warriors by offering to make them the core of El Hassan\u2019s Desert Legion during wartime and his policemen and rangers during peacetime. Rex Donaldson, ex-field expert for the African Department of the British Commonwealth, arrives to join Crawford's organization, bringing fieldworkers Jack and Jimmy Peters and David Moroka with him. As they are being briefed, David thwarts an assassination attempt against Crawford, killing the assassin. Crawford then sends Rex to recruit troops in Senegal and Mali. Now guarded by fifteen Tuareg warriors, Crawford\u2019s group travels the country to rally up forces for the upcoming Tamanrasset battle. They capture Dr. Warren Harding Smythe's American Medical Relief team and force them to join the group. As Crawford's team puts together El Hassan\u2019s government, Jack proposes that they make Esperanto the common language of the movement. Kenny Ballalou arrives from the West with news: several Reunited Nations development teams have joined El Hassan, so he now controls a large portion of North Africa. As El Hassan's influence grows, so does his camp, which fills with reporters and foreign diplomats anxious to meet him.\nCrawford's group decides to use guerrilla tactics to disable the mechanized army of the Arab Union. They are reprieved from air attack temporarily when the Reunited Nations announces retaliation against any power that uses air combat. Meanwhile, David, who in reality is a Party member of the Soviet Complex, radios his superiors, revealing that he engineered the attempted assassination of Crawford to earn his trust. C.I.A. agent Fred Ostrander arrives at the camp to remind Crawford of his allegiance to the United States and the West, but Crawford responds that he is an African looking for African solutions to African problems. When Ostrander challenges Crawford to explain why he is the man to lead North Africa, Crawford responds that he was thrust into the job. He then expresses deep regret that becoming El Hassan led him to kill his best friend, Abe, who wanted him to swear allegiance to the Soviet Complex. Crawford's confession disarms David, whose spying has been fueled by a desire to revenge Abe.\nIsobel surprises David as he is reporting to his superiors, but when confronted by the team, David claims he has resigned from the Party and is now an El Hassan man. He also informs them that the Arab Union is planning to parachute troopers into various points of the Sahara. Ostrander, who has decided to join El Hassan's team as well, earns them some time by telling the commander of the Arab legion that the United States will send its own air force to aid El Hassan if the paratroopers are deployed. As everyone arms for battle, David and Ostrander have one last conversation, in which they insist that their long-term socioeconomical views have not changed, but that both believe African union takes precedence for the moment. They wish each other well during the coming fight.\nDuring the aftermath of the successful recapture of Tamanrasset, Crawford finds that Jack, David, and Ostrander are dead and that Kenny has been seriously hurt. He then receives good news and bad news: foreign countries and organizations have begun to recognize El Hassan as the legal head of North Africa; Elmer Allen has been captured by one of Crawford's enemies, the leader of the Ouled Touameur clan, Abd-el-Kader. To make matters worse, Abd-el-Kader now claims to be the reincarnation of the Mahdi, the holiest prophet since Mohammed, so that he can call on a holy war against El Hassan.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tamanrasset"}], "question": "Where do Dr. Crawford and his fowollers plan to meet after they seperate to gather troops?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He will make them the Core of El Hassan's Desert Legion during war and give them positions as police men and rangers when the conflicts ends."}], "question": "What does Dr. Crawford offer to the Taureg warriers to win their loyalty?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr. Warren Harding Smith's Amercan medical relief team."}], "question": "Who is captured by Dr. Crawfords group and then forced to join them?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Esperanto"}], "question": "As proposed by Jack what is the common language of Dr. Crawfords movement?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "David, to earn Dr. Crawford's trust."}], "question": "Who was reponible for the assassination attempt on Dr. Crawford, and why did they do it?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr. Crawford regrets that Abe died because of El Hassan's formation."}], "question": "What confession does Dr. Crawford make about the death of his former friend Abe that shocks David?", "id": "7ee7a5656b920c8b6e33cc3f970afa9501782393"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dr. Crawford and the El Hassan.

" Amateur tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to marry Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of a senator, and pursue a political career. First, he must divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam (Laura Elliott). On a train, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy and knows about his marital situation from the gossip pages. Bruno introduces himself, then proposes an idea for the perfect homicide: he and Guy should \"swap murders\". Bruno will murder Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's despised father. Each would be killing a stranger. Having no identifiable motive for the crimes, neither would be suspects. Guy humors Bruno's absurd murder plot by pretending to find it amusing. Bruno interprets this as agreement to the scheme. Bruno then borrows Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter and slips it into his own pocket.\nGuy meets with Miriam. Pregnant by someone else, she now refuses to give Guy a divorce and threatens to cause a scandal. Guy relays the bad news to Anne, metaphorically commenting that he would like to \"strangle\" Miriam. Meanwhile, Bruno stalks Miriam through an amusement park and fatally strangles her on the \"Magic Isle\". Bruno then informs Guy that Miriam is dead, and expects him to follow through on murdering Bruno's father. Bruno sends Guy his house key, a map to his father's bedroom, and a pistol.\nWhen the police question Guy about Miriam's death, he claims he was on a train at the time of the murder. The police determine his alibi is inconclusive because he could have left the train in time to commit the murder and continued his trip on another train. Guy is not arrested, but the police assign an officer to trail him to ensure he does not flee while they investigate.\nTo pressure Guy into fulfilling his obligation, Bruno introduces himself to Anne and meets Anne's younger sister, Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock), who physically resembles Miriam. Soon after, Bruno appears uninvited at a party at Senator Morton's house. To amuse another guest, Bruno demonstrates how to fatally strangle someone. His gaze happens to fall upon Barbara, and her resemblance to Miriam triggers a flashback. He begins strangling the woman but he blacks out before harming her. An upset Barbara tells Anne that, \"His hands were on her throat, but he was strangling me.\" Anne confronts Guy, who confesses the truth about Bruno's crazy scheme.\nPretending to agree to Bruno's original plan, Guy sneaks into Mr. Anthony's bedroom intending to warn him of his son's murderous intent. It is Bruno who is waiting there, however. Guy tries to convince Bruno to seek psychiatric help. When Guy refuses to follow through with Bruno's plan, Bruno threatens to frame Guy for Miriam's murder.\nAnne visits Bruno's mother (Marion Lorne) to tell her that her son committed a murder, but the befuddled woman discounts it. Bruno appears and informs Anne that he intends to incriminate Guy by planting the stolen cigarette lighter at the amusement park. Anne and Guy devise a plan for Guy to finish his tennis match, evade the police, and reach the amusement park to prevent Bruno from planting the lighter.\nGuy eventually wins the long match at Forest Hills, then, eluding the police, heads for the amusement park. Bruno is also delayed when he accidentally drops Guy's lighter down a storm drain and has to recover it. Guy arrives at the amusement park. Bruno stays out of sight until sunset when he can plant the lighter on the \"Magic Isle\". A worker recognizes Bruno from the night of the murder and informs the police. Guy catches up to Bruno, and they fight on the park's carousel. Thinking Guy is trying to escape, a police officer shoots at him, but his shot misses and kills the carousel operator instead. The dead man falls onto the control panel, and the carousel spins wildly out of control and crashes. The worker who recognized Bruno tells the police that Guy is innocent, and the mortally injured Bruno is the man he saw that night. Guy tells the police that Bruno was attempting to plant Guy's lighter at the murder scene. Bruno refuses to clear Guy, but as he dies, his fingers open to reveal Guy's lighter.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "amateur tennis player"}], "question": "What is Guy Haine's

friends who have been in a rut in their lives: Adam Yates (John Cusack) is dumped by his girlfriend; Nick Webber-Agnew (Craig Robinson) is a henpecked husband with a dead-end job at a dog spa; and Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) is a party animal in his 40s. When Lou is hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning, Adam and Nick sympathetically take him and Adam's shut-in 20-year-old nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) to a ski resort at Kodiak Valley, where the three had some good times in the past. During a night of heavy drinking in the hotel room's hot tub, they spill the contents of a drink called Chernobly on the console. The next day, they go skiing, but after too many strange occurrences (people dressed in 1980s fashion, music videos on MTV, and that Michael Jackson is still black), they realize they have traveled back to 1986. Not only that, but they have also assumed their younger bodies: they see each other as their normal age, but in their reflections and to other people, they appear as they did back then, except Jacob, who appears as himself but occasionally flickers.\nA mysterious hot tub repairman (Chevy Chase) appears and warns them not to change anything as it might affect the machine. In order to minimize the butterfly effect, the guys plan to re-enact their experiences. Adam has to break up with his girlfriend Jenny (Lyndsy Fonseca) and get stabbed in the eye with a fork; Lou must pick a fight and get beaten up by Blaine (Sebastian Stan), a ski patrol bully; and Nick must have sex with a groupie, and give a bad performance with his band at an open mic event. Jacob discovers his mother Kelly (Collette Wolfe) is at the resort but is acting rather slutty; he tries to figure out who is his father.\nThe guys find the tasks rather difficult as Lou gets punched by Blaine and loses his backpack, but realizes he must face him again later at night, so he reluctantly challenges him again. Adam falls in love with Jenny again while meeting a music journalist named April (Lizzy Caplan) during the Poison concert. Nick worries about cheating on his wife even though the events occur before he even meets her. Later on, Lou tries to cash in on some sports betting using his knowledge of the game's outcomes; it works until he risks everything on predicting a game-winning touchdown, only to have the squirrel that he vomited on earlier at the resort crash the field and ruin the play.\nJenny turns the tables as she initiates the breakup with Adam, but Adam later meets April and they get along. Nick changes his destiny by covering the more upbeat \"Jessie's Girl\", followed by a \"preview version\" of \"Let's Get It Started\". When the repairman later informs Jacob that some nuclear chemical was the key to their time travel, Jacob realizes it was the \"Chernobly\", an illegal Russian energy drink. The guys rescue Lou, who was beaten up without his friends again, from falling off the rooftop. They go to Blaine's cabin to search for the drink, during which Lou finds and seduces Kelly. The guys realize that Lou is actually Jacob's father. After Lou finally punches Blaine, they retrieve the Chernobly and return to the hot tub where they create a vortex. Jacob and Nick get in the tub but Lou decides to stay in 1986, admitting he had indeed attempted suicide before. Adam volunteers to stay with Lou, but is thrown into the vortex.\nBack at the present, Adam, Nick, and Jacob discover that Lou has changed history by founding \"Lougle\", and is enjoying a luxurious lifestyle with Kelly. Adam discovers that he is happily married to April, and Nick discovers he is a successful music producer married to a loyal and loving Courtney. The guys reunite at Lou's mansion with their families, satisfied with their new lives. During the film's closing credits, Lou is shown to be the frontman of \"Motley L\u7aefe\" and sings in a video \"Home Sweet Home\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Chernobly."}],

Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovations is the use of a public trial by ordeal as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public arena and must choose one of two doors. Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it.\nThe king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.\nThe outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. The story ends with the question, \"And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the lady, or the tiger?\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "trial by ordeal"}], "question": "What type of trial does the king impose on the citizens?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a public arena"}], "question": "Where do the trials in the story take place?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "choose between two doors"}], "question": "What choice must an accused person make in the trials?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "marraige"}], "question": "What is the outcome of a trail for someone deemed innocent?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "death by tiger"}], "question": "What is the outcome of a trial for someone deemed guilty?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he is of a lower status"}], "question": "Why does the king make his daughter's lover stand trial?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he will either die or marry someone else"}], "question": "Why is the princess conflicted about whether to help her lover in his trial?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the story doesn't reveal it"}], "question": "What is the outcome of the princess's lover's trial?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the one on the right"}], "question": "Which door does the princess instruct her lover to open during the trial?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he has the doors soundproofed."}], "question": "How does the king ensure the people standing trial can't hear the tiger behind the door?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A prisoner has to choose one of two doors."}], "question": "How is innocence and guilt determined in the kingdom?", "id": "8127b75c8994e66d143f00e64ba75d5ee050ad15"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He will be eaten by a hungry tiger.

Suffering from numerous physical ailments and growing increasingly alienated from his wife, Adele, an artist, he hits bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in Berlin, taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive, with her.\nAfter the success of his production of Death of a Salesman, Caden unexpectedly receives a MacArthur Fellowship, which gives him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a disastrous fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic functions one by one.\nAs the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelg\ucc44ngers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide.\nAs he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained (and likely in-universe) calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden says that now he has an idea of how to do the play when the director's voice in his ear gives him his final cue: \"Die.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Adele"}], "question": "Who is Caden Cotard's wife?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Berlin"}], "question": "Where does Adele go when she leaves Caden?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "her daughter Olive"}], "question": "Who does Adele take with her to Berlin?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "MacArthur Fellowship"}], "question": "What award does Caden win for the Death of a Salesman production?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Claire"}], "question": "Who does Caden marry after separation from Adele?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sammy"}], "question": "Who kills themself in the story?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sammy Barnathan"}], "question": "Who plays Caden in the play by Caden?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An artist"}], "question": "What was Adele's occupation?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "in a large warehouse in Manhattan Theater District"}], "question": "Where does Caden's cast rehearse their plays?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Four years old"}], "question": "How old is Olive when Adele leaves Caden?", "id": "812fcb34b18fa3ebdce2e26f5a31c3cc8683e72f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is a theater director.

Ellen is a young, beautiful girl and attracts the attentions of the college boys, especially Edward Walcott, a strapping though immature student, and Fanshawe, a reclusive, meek intellectual. While out walking, the three young people meet a nameless character called \u201cthe angler,\u201d a name he gets for appearing an expert fisherman. The angler asks for a word with Ellen, tells her something in secret, and apparently flusters her. Walcott and Fanshawe become suspicious of his intentions.\nWe learn that the angler is an old friend of the reformed Inn owner, Hugh Crombie. The two had been at sea together, where Mr. Langton had been the angler's mentor and caretaker. Langton and the angler had a falling out, however, and, thinking that Langton has been killed at sea, the angler undertakes to marry Ellen in order to inherit her father's considerable wealth. Thus in his secret meeting with Ellen, the angler instructs her to sneak out of Melmoth's home and follow him, telling her he has information about her father\u2019s whereabouts. His real aim, though, is to kidnap her, to tell her of her father\u2019s death, and to manipulate her into marrying him.\nWhen the various men (Melmoth, Edward, Fanshawe) learn that she is not in her chamber, they go searching for her. The search reveals the nature of each: Melmoth, an aged scholar unused to physical labor, enlists the help of Walcott, who is the most skilled rider and the most likely to be able to contend with the angler in a fight. Fanshawe, who lags behind the search because of his weak constitution and his slow horse, is given information by an old woman in a cabin (where another old woman, Widow Butler, who turns out to be the angler's mother, has just died) that allows him to reach the angler and Ellen first. The angler has taken Ellen to a craggy cliff and cave, where he intends to hold her captive. Ellen has finally realized the angler's intentions. When Fanshawe arrives, he stands above them, looking over the edge of the cliff. The angler begins to climb up the cliff to fight Fanshawe but grabs a twig too weak to support him and tumbles to his death. Fanshawe awakens Ellen from a faint, and they travel back to town together.\nFanshawe loves Ellen but knows that he will die young because of his shut-in lifestyle. When Langton offers Ellen's hand in marriage to Fanshawe in exchange for rescuing her, he refuses, sacrificing his happiness so as not to subject her to a life of widowhood. He also knows that Ellen has affections for Walcott. Fanshawe dies at 20. Ellen and Walcott marry four years later. The narrator states that Walcott grows out of his childish ways (drunkenness, impulsiveness, the suggestion of teenage affairs) and becomes content with Ellen. They are, according to the narrator, happy, but the book ends on an ambivalent note, stating that the couple did not produce children.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ellen Langton "}], "question": "Who does Dr. Melmoth take into his care?", "id": "818bfd881f6099dc585792bba69b492a111e7793"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Edward Walcott and Fanshawe "}], "question": "Who accompanied Ellen on a walk where they met \"the angler\"?", "id": "818bfd881f6099dc585792bba69b492a111e7793"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By appealing an expert fisherman"}], "question": "How did the angler acquire his nickname?", "id": "818bfd881f6099dc585792bba69b492a111e7793"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was his mentor and caretaker.

The police reveal that an obscene letter was found in Gruneman's office, addressed to a prostitute in New York City named Bree Daniels (Fonda), who had received several similar letters from him. After six months of fruitless police work, Peter Cable (Cioffi), an executive at Gruneman's company, hires family friend and detective John Klute (Sutherland) to investigate Gruneman's disappearance.\nKlute rents an apartment in the basement of Daniels' building, taps her phone, and follows her as she turns tricks. Daniels appears to be liberated by the freedom of freelancing as a call girl, but in a series of visits to her psychiatrist (Vivian Nathan), she reveals the emptiness of her life and that she wants to quit. Klute asks Daniels to answer some of his questions, but she refuses. He approaches her again, revealing that he has been watching her. She does not recall Gruneman. She reveals that she was beaten by one of her johns two years earlier, but after seeing a photo of Gruneman, she says she cannot say for sure.\nDaniels takes Klute to meet her former pimp, Frank Ligourin (Scheider), who reveals that one of his prostitutes, Jane McKenna, passed the abusive client on to Bree and another prostitute named Arlyn Page (Dorothy Tristan). McKenna committed suicide and Page became a drug addict and disappeared. Klute and Daniels develop a romance, though she tells her psychiatrist that she fears these feelings and wishes she could go back to \"just feeling numb.\" She admits to Klute a deep paranoia that she is being watched.\nThey find Page, who tells them the customer was not Gruneman but an older man. Page's body then turns up in the Kill Van Kull. Klute deduces a connection between the two \"suicides\" of the prostitutes, surmising that the client probably also killed Gruneman and may kill Daniels next. He revisits Gruneman's contacts to find connections with the case. By typographic comparison, the supposed obscene letters of Gruneman are traced to Cable, with whom Klute has been meeting to report on his investigation.\nKlute asks Cable for an additional $500 to buy the \"black book\" of the first prostitute who apparently committed suicide, telling Cable he is certain the book will reveal the identity of the abusive client. Cable corners Bree and reveals that he sent her the letters, explaining that Gruneman had interrupted him when he was attacking a prostitute. Certain that Gruneman would use the incident as leverage against him within the company, Cable attempted to frame Gruneman by planting the letter in his office. He confesses to the killings. After playing an audiotape he made as he murdered Page, he attacks Daniels. Klute rushes in, and Cable jumps or is thrown out a window to his death (the film uses ambiguous editing).\nDaniels moves out of her apartment with Klute's help, though her voiceover with her psychiatrist reveals her fear of domestic life and a likelihood that the doctor will \"see me next week.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pennsylvania"}], "question": "From what state is Tom Gruneman?", "id": "84419aee286a289ad219d380579e3b92ae2b6679"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bree Daniels"}], "question": "Whose phone does John Klute tap?", "id": "84419aee286a289ad219d380579e3b92ae2b6679"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Former pimp"}], "question": "Frank Ligourin is what to Bree Daniels?", "id": "84419aee286a289ad219d380579e3b92ae2b6679"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That she is being watched."}], "question": "Bree Daniels suffers from what paranoia?", "id": "84419aee286a289ad219d380579e3b92ae2b6679"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Kill Van Knull"}], "question": "Arlyn Page's body is found where?", "id": "84419aee286a289ad219d380579e3b92ae2b6679"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peter Cable"}], "question": "John Klute traces the letters to who?

When the children are asleep, Jill receives a telephone call from a man who asks her if she has checked the children. At first, Jill dismisses the telephone calls as a practical joke. However, as the calls become more frequent and threatening, Jill becomes frightened and decides to call the police, who promise to trace the caller if Jill keeps him on the telephone line long enough. Jill, frightened to extreme measures, arms herself as she receives one final call from the nefarious stalker. Soon after the conversation, Jill receives a call from the police, only to find out that the stalker is calling from inside the house. A light comes on at the top of the staircase, and Jill sees the stalker's shadow. In a panic, she immediately runs to the door, unhooks the chain lock only to reveal a close-up of a detective when she screams. The camera then zooms out.\nAfterwards, Officer John Clifford (Charles Durning) investigates the matter. It turns out that the children were murdered by the perp several hours earlier. The killer is identified as an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley), and is subsequently sent to an asylum.\nSeven years later, Duncan escapes from the asylum, still psychopathic. Dr. Mandrakis hires Clifford, now a private investigator to find Duncan. Not knowing Clifford is after him, Duncan is now a homeless, vagrant loner. He gets into a fight and is beaten after disturbing a middle-aged woman, Tracy (Colleen Dewhurst), in a tavern, and later follows her to her apartment. Feeling sorry for his disastrous appearance and for the fact that his attempts at conversation with her started the fight in the first place, Tracy makes light conversation with him. While they are in the doorway talking, Tracy's phone rings. As she goes to answer it, Duncan lets himself and appears behind her when she gets off the phone. She explicitly rebuffs his awkward proposal to visit her for coffee the next night, assuming or hoping it will be the last of him she will see.\nMeanwhile an increasingly obsessed and vindictive Clifford, having confided to a former partner (Ron O'Neal) that his intention is to kill Duncan rather than arrest him, follows the trail to the tavern where the fight took place, then to Tracy's residence\u00e2\u0080\u0094the same night Duncan is likely to arrive for his visit. Clifford goes there and tells Tracy just how dangerous her situation has become, revealing that Duncan literally tore and hacked up Mandrakis' children with his bare hands, rendering them virtually unrecognizable. Tracy reluctantly accepts to be Clifford's bait at the tavern that evening, but Duncan does not arrive and she decides to return home. Clifford then leaves Tracy's place, but she is then attacked by Duncan, who was hiding in her closet. Tracy screams for help, and Clifford returns and chases Duncan away from the scene. In the streets of downtown Los Angeles, he loses Duncan's trail.\nJill Johnson is now an adult, married with two young children. One night, she and her husband Stephen go out to dinner in celebration of a promotion, and a friend named Sharon babysits her children. At the restaurant, Jill gets a telephone call from someone asking, \"Have you checked the children?\" Jill panics and calls Sharon. It appears that nothing is wrong at first, but then the call is suddenly disconnected. The police arrive and escort Jill back home and find that everything is fine. Clifford tries to call Jill, but finds that the line is disconnected. Jill and Stephen sleep. Later, Jill goes down for a glass of milk, when the lights suddenly go out. She goes back upstairs and returns to bed. She picks up the phone and discovers that the phone line is dead. The closet door opens a little, and she hears the voice of Curt Duncan. She tries to awaken Stephen, who turns around, revealing that it is actually Curt in the bed. He rips Jill's nightgown and chases her around the room. Clifford arrives and shoots Curt, killing him. Stephen is revealed to be in the closet, alive but seemingly unconscious. As Clifford comforts Jill, the last view is of the house, in view of the frightening eyes of Curt Duncan.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is babysitting for Dr. Mandrakis."}], "question": "What is Jill doing when she gets a phone call that she thinks is a practical joke?", "id": "8501cab146742babe04bc3984eb34409d97078a1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jill calls the police who promise to put a trace on the phone.

Infected vampires are turned into Reapers, mutants immune to all vampire weaknesses with the exception of bright light. Unable to contain the Reapers, vampire lord Eli Damaskinos sends two emissaries, Asad and Nyssa, to seek the aid of vampire hunter Blade and his team, consisting of weaponsmith Abraham Whistler and his assistant Scud. Damaskinos introduces them to the Bloodpack, a group of vampires trained for the sole purpose of killing Blade. In addition to Asad and Nyssa, the Bloodpack consists of Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Verlaine, her lover Lighthammer, and Priest. To keep them in line, Blade plants an explosive charge on the back of Reinhardt's head.\nOn Blade's advice, the team starts by investigating a local nightclub frequented by vampires. When they do encounter Reapers, they soon discover that their weapons and powers are completely ineffective. Blade is forced to kill Priest after he becomes infected, Lighthammer is wounded, Whistler deserts his post, and Scud barely survives a Reaper attack by using UV lights to scare them off. One of the Reapers, Jared Novak, attacks and nearly kills Blade before a burst of sunlight forces him to retreat. Whistler reappears and explains that he has been tracking the Reapers to a central nest in the sewers. Having learned of their prime weakness, he and Scud create UV projectors for the team.\nWhile searching for the nest, Lighthammer succumbs to infection, killing Snowman and Verlaine before dying of light exposure. Chupa turns on Whistler and attacks him, only to die when a group of Reapers attracted to his scent tear him apart. Asad is ambushed, dragged underwater, and killed. Using a special UV emitter, Blade kills all of the Reapers with the exception of Novak and rescues Reinhardt and Nyssa, bringing them to Whistler.\nDamaskinos betrays Blade and Whistler, revealing that he created the Reaper virus in order to create a new race of vampires and that Nomak is in fact his son. Scud turns out to be a familiar loyal to Reinhardt, who also works for Damaskinos. Explaining that he always knew of Scud's true allegiance, Blade kills him with the bomb he placed earlier. Damaskinos then orders his scientists to dissect Blade so that he can learn how to replicate his abilities. After escaping his captors, Whistler brings Blade to a blood vault, where he regains enough strength to kill Reinhardt and his men.\nSeeking revenge, Nomak tracks Damaskinos to his private heliport and kills him. He then bites Nyssa, infecting her with the virus. Blade confronts Nomak and helps him commit suicide to end his suffering. Fulfilling Nyssa's dying wish, Blade takes her outside, where she dies while watching the sun rise.

During the crash landing, several passenger compartments are destroyed and Owens sustains fatal injuries.\nThe group explore their surroundings. Riddick escapes and Johns warns everyone that he may kill them all. They notice that the three suns surrounding the planet keep it in perpetual daylight. Zeke goes missing and while searching for him, Fry escapes from photosensitive aggressive underground creatures. They find an abandoned geological research settlement, with a dropship with drained batteries. Inside the settlement, one of the young pilgrims is killed by the creatures. An orrery shows that an eclipse is imminent and that the creatures will be free to hunt above ground. Riddick rejoins the group and they return to the crash site to retrieve the power cells to power the dropship. Riddick reveals that Johns is not actually a law officer, but a bounty hunter who is attempting to collect the bounty on Riddick.\nThe group reaches the wreckage, but the eclipse begins before they can return to the settlement. The creatures pour out of the ground and kill Shazza and another of the children. The group decides to salvage any light source that they can and attempts to return to the dropship. Riddick agrees to lead them. En route Riddick reveals that Jack is actually a girl and the scent of her menstrual blood is attracting the creatures. Johns suggests to Riddick that he kill Jack and use her corpse as bait to keep the creatures off the rest of the group. Riddick instead wounds Johns, who is attacked by the creatures, providing a distraction.\nFry, Jack, Riddick and Imam make it to a cave near the ship after a rain puts out their flares. Riddick seals them in the cave and takes the power cells. Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering up the ship to leave without them. She pleads with him to help her rescue Imam and Jack, but instead he offers to take her with him. Riddick has a change of heart and they retrieve Imam and Jack and take them to the ship, but Riddick is separated from the group and is wounded by the predators. Fry returns to help Riddick but she is killed after finding him. Riddick makes it to the ship and waits until the last moment before engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible. In orbit, Riddick tells Jack to tell anyone they meet that Riddick died on the planet below, and they depart for New Mecca.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Surgically modified eyes that can see in the dark."}], "question": "What is Riddick's unusual physical feature?

Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from Silver Creek, Colorado to his home in New York City, he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home. When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden, with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims she is his \"number one fan\" and talks a lot about him and his novels. As a reward for saving him, Paul gives Annie his new manuscript which she saved from the wreckage. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but regains control and apologizes. She buys a copy of Paul's most recently published book, Misery's Child, giving glowing praise to Paul as she progresses through the book. However, when Annie discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book she flies into a rage, almost smashing a table on Paul's head. She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities; nobody knows where he is. Annie leaves and Paul tries to escape from his room, but she has locked the door.\nThe next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel entitled Misery's Return, in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. He also tells her he will use Annie's name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health. However, having found a way of escaping his room, he sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers. He tries poisoning Annie during a candlelit dinner, but fails when she accidentally spills her drugged wine. During another venture out of his room, Paul finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie's past. He discovers that she was suspected and tried for the deaths of several infants, but the trial crumbled due to lack of evidence. Paul also learns that Annie quoted lines he had written in his Misery novels during her trial. Annie later drugs Paul and straps him to the bed. When he wakes, she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from trying to escape again.\nThe local sheriff, Buster (Richard Farnsworth), is investigating Paul's disappearance. When a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold Annie considerable quantities of typing paper, Buster surmises Paul must be at the Wilkes farm. Buster pays Annie a visit, who permits the sheriff to inspect the residence. When Buster finds Paul drugged and hidden in the basement, Annie fatally shoots Buster and tells Paul that they must die together. He agrees, on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to \"give Misery back to the world\". While she gets his chair, Paul conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket.\nWhen the book is done, he reminds Annie it is his practice to have a single cigarette and a glass of champagne after finishing a novel. When Annie gives these things to Paul, he tells her that this time, he will need a second glass, for her. As Annie gets a second glass, Paul soaks the manuscript in the lighter fluid. When Annie returns with the glass he sets the manuscript on fire, giving him the chance to hit Annie over the head with the typewriter. Paul and Annie fight and Annie is killed.\nEighteen months later, Paul, now walking with a cane, meets his publishing agent Marcia (Lauren Bacall) in a restaurant in New York City. The two discuss his first non-Misery novel. Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz which Paul does not care about, saying he wrote the novel for himself. Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity, but Paul declines. While at the restaurant, he imagines the waitress as Annie. The waitress says she is his \"number one fan\", to which Paul uncomfortably responds \"That's very sweet of you\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "she locked the door"}],

Errol lives with his mother (known only as Mrs. Errol or \"Dearest\") in genteel poverty after the death of his father, Captain Cedric Errol. One day, they are visited by an English lawyer named Havisham with a message from Cedric's grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, an unruly millionaire who despises America and was very disappointed when his youngest son married an American lady. With the deaths of his father's elder brothers, Cedric has now inherited the title Lord Fauntleroy and is the heir to the earldom and a vast estate. Cedric's grandfather wants him to live in England and be educated as an English aristocrat. He offers his son's widow a house and guaranteed income, but he refuses to have anything to do with her, even after she declines his money.\nHowever, the Earl is impressed by the appearance and intelligence of his American grandson and is charmed by his innocent nature. Cedric believes his grandfather to be an honorable man and benefactor, and the Earl cannot disappoint him. He therefore becomes a benefactor to his tenants, to their delight, though takes care to let them know that their benefactor is the child, Lord Fauntleroy.\nMeanwhile, a homeless bootblack named Dick Tipton tells Cedric's old friend Mr. Hobbs, a New York City grocer, that a few years prior, after the death of his parents, Dick's older brother Benjamin married an awful woman who got rid of their only child together after he was born and then left. Benjamin moved to California to open a cattle ranch while Dick ended up in the streets. At the same time, a neglected pretender to Cedric's inheritance appears, the pretender's mother claiming that he is the offspring of the Earl's eldest son. The claim is investigated by Dick and Benjamin, who come to England and recognize the alleged heir's mother as Benjamin's former wife. The alleged heir's mother flees, and the Tipton brothers and Benjamin's son do not see her again. Afterwards, Benjamin goes back to his cattle ranch in California where he happily raises his son by himself. The Earl is reconciled to his American daughter-in-law, realizing that she is far superior to the imposter.\nThe Earl planned to teach his grandson how to be an aristocrat. Instead, Cedric teaches his grandfather that an aristocrat should practice compassion towards those dependent on him. He becomes the man Cedric always innocently believed him to be.

When Lady Glencora dies unexpectedly, the Duke is left to deal with his grownup children, with whom he has a somewhat distant relationship. As the government in which he is Prime Minister has also fallen, the Duke is left bereft of both his beloved wife and his political position.\nBefore her death, Lady Glencora had imprudently given her secret blessing to her daughter Mary's courtship by a poor gentleman, Frank Tregear, a friend of Lord Silverbridge, the Duke's older son and heir. Mrs. Finn, Lady Glencora's dearest confidante, somewhat uneasily remains after the funeral as a companion and unofficial chaperone for Mary at the Duke's request. Once she becomes aware of the seriousness of the relationship between Mary and Frank, Mrs. Finn insists that the Duke be informed.\nThe Duke's two sons also prove burdensome. Lord Silverbridge follows the wishes of his father by entering Parliament. He had proposed to Lady Mabel Grex, whom he has known all his life. She turned him down, although with an indication of a more welcoming answer another time. However, Lord Silverbridge becomes enamoured with American heiress Isabel Boncassen. She agrees to marry him, but only if the Duke is willing to welcome her into the family. At first, the Duke disapproves; and he disapproves even more of his daughter's suitor. To add to his troubles, Gerald, the younger son, gets himself expelled from Cambridge after attending the Derby without permission.\nHowever, by the end of the book, the Duke grows closer to all three of his children; he allows the engagements of both son and daughter, and he is invited once more to take a part in the government.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Glencora."}], "question": "Who dies unexpectedly?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His grownup children who he is somewhat distant with."}], "question": "What is her husband Duke of Omnium left to deal with?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She secretly blessed her the courtship of her daughter Mary and a poor man."}], "question": "What did Lady Glencora do before she died?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mrs. Finn, Lady Glencora's closest confidante."}], "question": "Who insists that the Duke be informed of Mary's courtship?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Entering Parliarment."}], "question": "What wish of his father's does Lord Silverbridge follow?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Mabel Grex."}], "question": "Who had Lord Silverbridge proposed to but was turned down by?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "American heiress Isabel Boncassen."}], "question": "Who does Lord Silverbridge fall in love with?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That the Duke will welcome her into the family."}], "question": "On what condition does Isabel agree to marry Lord Silverbridge?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gets himself expelled from Cambridge."}], "question": "What does Gerald, the youngest son of the Duke do?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The marriage of both his children, Mary and Lord Silverbridge."}], "question": "What does the Duke allow?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Duke of Omnium"}], "question": "What is the title of Plantagenet Palliser?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Prime Minister"}], "question": "What was the Duke of Omnium's political position before the government fell?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Glencora"}], "question": "What was the Duke of Omnium's wife's name?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mrs. Finn."}], "question": "Who was Lady Glencora's closest confidant?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Frank Tregear"}], "question": "To Whom did Lady Glencora give her blessing that her daughter could court?", "id": "8b5a5e185f5a7d9f240a38d396205831967418ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The seriousness of the relationship between Mary and Frank."}], "question": "What does Mrs. Finn insist that the Duke of Omnium must be told of?

This idea was thought up by a TV producer named Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres). They interview Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) and his brother, Ray (Woody Harrelson). When the producers see the interview Cynthia decides to use Ed and interviews only Ed. So now they start airing the show, which they call Ed TV. The show is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen and the main producers want to pull the plug, except for Cynthia.\nHowever, Ed TV suddenly gets interesting on Day 3 when Ed visits Ray. Ed (along with the cameramen) discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman). Ed then visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray's actions. Shari is very drunk and starts insulting Ray, by talking to the camera. She makes everyone laugh and gasp by saying \"Ray was a bad lay.\" Ed tries to comfort Shari, and he reveals he has feelings for her. She then reveals she has feelings for Ed as well. They slowly move their faces closer and finally kiss each other. Ed then locks out the camera crew and proceeds to passionately kiss Shari for a while. Ed TV suddenly becomes extremely popular. On Cynthia's insistence, Ed starts a relationship with Shari, which is short lived as Ed grows more interested in staying on TV and Shari is abused by viewers who find her unappealing.\nEd then goes on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and meets beautiful model/actress Jill (Elizabeth Hurley) who takes a liking to Ed. Ed then visits Shari and she tells Ed that she does not want to be with him until the Show stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to the park with Ray and some friends to play football when Jill comes to talk to him, because Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. She invites Ed to dinner at her house. When he arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. They have a small talk, and then they kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but then Ed falls off the table and squishes Jill's cat. Ed never sees Jill again.\nEd's father (Dennis Hopper), who abandoned his family when Ed was 13, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al (Martin Landau). Ed is furious with his mother and argues with her. Next, Ed gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital. The doctor says that his father is dead and that he died making love to his wife. Ed thinks this means Al, but it actually is his real father and that Ed's mother was cheating on Al.\nAfter the funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by the fact that the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he catches a glimpse of Shari (in disguise wearing a wig and sunglasses). He chases her for a long time until she stops in the women's bathroom in a movie theater. She says she is staying with her brother as it is his birthday and she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one camera man stays with Shari saying that it is the producers' new idea. The main camera man tells him that all his family are being filmed, but they show the most interesting person.\nEd gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from showing the show: he says that he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of \"dirt\" on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection) but before he can announce who it is they stop airing the show.\nAfter the camera crew finally leaves Ed's apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate the fact that TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "True TV"}], "question": "Which channel EDtv associated  with?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cynthia"}], "question": "Who thought the idea of interviewing normal person 24/7 to the True TV?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "When Ed met his brother Ray and found him cheating on his girl friend Shari."}], "question": "How Edtv became popular?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He has soft corner for Sheri."}], "question": "What were Ed's feeings for Shari?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because main producers found Ed more productive then Ray."}], "question": "Why Cynthia decided to drop Ray from the show?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she was uncomfortable with present show and wanted to have some privacy."}], "question": "Why Shari left Ed?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cynthia helped Ed by telling him a secrete of main producer."}], "question": "Who helped Ed in airing off the show?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ed TV"}], "question": "What is the name of the TV show that Ed is the star of?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A cat"}], "question": "What animal does ED squish by falling off of a table?", "id": "8bed193f6ba9d1e50cc86f0b56531dc33bb8d409"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ray"}], "question": "Who does Ed find is cheating on their girlfriend?

F. J. Payne concisely summarized the Fourfold Root.\nOur knowing consciousness...is divisible solely into subject and object. To be object for the subject and to be our representation or mental picture are one and the same. All our representations are objects for the subject, and all objects of the subject are our representations. These stand to one another in a regulated connection which in form is determinable a priori, and by virtue of this connection nothing existing by itself and independent, nothing single and detached, can become an object for us. ...The first aspect of this principle is that of becoming, where it appears as the law of causality and is applicable only to changes. Thus if the cause is given, the effect must of necessity follow. The second aspect deals with concepts or abstract representations, which are themselves drawn from representations of intuitive perception, and here the principle of sufficient reason states that, if certain premises are given, the conclusion must follow. The third aspect of the principle is concerned with being in space and time, and shows that the existence of one relation inevitably implies the other, thus that the equality of the angles of a triangle necessarily implies the equality of its sides and vice versa. Finally, the fourth aspect deals with actions, and the principle appears as the law of motivation, which states that a definite course of action inevitably ensues on a given character and motive.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Two.

Their dreams are cut short when their car breaks down in a tiny Utah town. They are saved by the town bad boy, Randy (Westwick), who takes them to the local motel where they meet the conspiracy-loving owner. He tells them of Billy Moorcroft, a boy who went missing.\nSamantha starts sleepwalking. A future version of her meets Justin (James Lafferty) at the windmill and tells him that the world will end; however, Justin knows this already. The next morning Samantha wakes up on a bus stop bench, where a policeman finds her and warns her about a pervert. He offers to drive her back to the motel but the two end up stopping at the site where a meteorite crashed. Samantha tells Corey that she doesn't remember what happened the night before.\nWhile at a cafe, a science-loving geek, Jeremy (Jackson Rathbone), tries to talk about the meteorite with Samantha. Randy invites the two girls to a party, where he tells her of his brother who went missing and how hard it has been on his family. Future Samantha stands in the middle of a road and is nearly hit by a car; Justin sees her and is entranced. Her ghost takes him to the local nondenominational church and commands him to burn it down.\nThe next day they find Justin's dog tags in the ashes of the church. Samantha runs into Jeremy, who is beginning to show signs of radiation exposure. Subsequently, Justin has begun working on forging a bunny-skull mask out of metal, saying he needs to help \"his princess.\" Samantha wanders the town and soon encounters Randy and Corey. Samantha tells Corey how she wants to get out of town but the two get into a fight. Samantha runs away, and Randy's car is unexpectedly run into by another car, pushing his car into Samantha and killing her.\nCorey is full of anguish about her best friend's death. She finds a book about time travel as well as a story Samantha wrote as a child, entitled The Last Unicorn, about a princess and a boy named Justin. A boy appears, and commands Corey to come with him in order to save Samantha. She follows him to a cave where she goes through a portal that takes her back in time. Everything moves backwards to when Samantha is walking down the road. Corey and Randy drive up to Samantha again and when they stop, Corey is nicer to her. As Randy drives off, the other car still runs into him, and this time Corey is killed instead.\nSamantha is devastated by Corey's death. After another sleepwalking incident, she sees a dress in the window of the vintage shop Jeremy's parents own. It is the same dress she wears as Future Samantha. Jeremy sees her admiring it and begins talking more about the meteorite he bought. Samantha notices tissue damage on Jeremy's arm and when told about it, he quickly covers it up and calls it a rash.\nThe next morning Samantha wakes up on the hill where Justin is. He takes the book about time travel from her and explains that it was written by his grandmother. He asks her to \"show him how to do it\" but she doesn't understand. He tells her that he made his mask from a drawing by Donnie, Samantha's deceased brother, that she showed him. She asks how he knew her brother's name and he responds by saying she told him \"when she was dead\". Samantha walks away and finds the bodies of two dead boys, Randy's little brother and the boy that appeared to Corey, Billy Moorcroft.\nAfter telling the police about what she saw, everyone assumes that Justin is responsible. He soon asks Samantha to \"show him how\" again. The police then take him into custody. That night, Samantha returns to her motel where she finds the dress she saw at the shop, a gift from Jeremy. He asks her to wear it to see the fireworks with him. They go to a remote location and Jeremy sees what he calls tesseracts falling from the sky. He becomes manic and Samantha notes that his rash has gotten much worse. He tries to kiss Samantha but she resists and he eventually pushes her back roughly, killing her.\nFuture Samantha, now identical to regular Samantha, visits Justin in jail. Randy tries to find her as fiery tesseracts fall from the sky and eventually finds her where Jeremy left her. Justin approaches and sees his mask, putting it on. Justin then goes back in time. He climbs the windmill that was destroyed at the beginning. Justin believes that his death will prevent the series of events that will lead to the end of the world so he stays on the windmill this time and is killed by the meteorite.\nIt is now the morning after the meteorite landing again. Samantha and Corey visit the site and find the locals are saddened as they take away Justin's body. Samantha, never having experienced the events after the meteorite crash, decides to go back home while Corey stays with Randy.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Randy."}],

She fails the audition and soon learns that her mother was involved in a fatal car accident in her haste to get to the audition.\nSara is wracked by guilt and gives up on ballet. She moves in with her estranged father and transfers to an urban Chicago school. At her new school, Sara is one of a handful of white students but quickly befriends Chenille, a single teen mother who is having relationship problems. Chenille invites Sara to a dance club called STEPPS, where she has her first experience of dancing to hip hop rhythms. At STEPPS, Sara dances with Derek, Chenille's brother and a student with dreams of ultimately attending Georgetown Medical School. He decides to help Sara develop her dancing skills by incorporating more hip hop into her style. Derek takes a reluctant Sara to the Joffrey Ballet and, afterwards, Sara confides in him about her mother and her dreams. Later, they return to the club and amaze others with their dancing. Having achieved his dream of being accepted at Georgetown University, Derek convinces her to follow her dreams of Juilliard. Eventually, Sara and Derek begin a relationship.\nAt school, Nikki, Derek's jealous ex-girlfriend, picks a fight with Sara. Chenille tells Sara that she didn't approve of the fight but can understand the bitterness since Sara, a white girl, is seen as stealing one of the few decent black men in the school. Because of this, Sara breaks up with Derek. Meanwhile, Derek deals with his friend Malakai, who is heavily into the gang lifestyle that Derek is trying to leave. Derek accepts Malakai's plea for support in a drive-by for the same time as Sara's audition. Sara's father has a heart-to-heart talk with her and encourages her to audition for Juilliard again.\nAfter hearing what Chenille told Sara, Derek confronts her. She admits what she did was wrong and encourages him to be with Sara. Chenille also warns Derek not to support Malakai knowing the consequences and he will lose his chance to attend Georgetown. Derek turns his back on Malakai to attend Sara's audition. He arrives at a crucial point to offer her encouragement and moral support.

The unnamed narrator tells his dreams to a friend, Severin, who tells him how to break himself of his fascination with cruel women by reading a manuscript, Memoirs of a Suprasensual Man.\nThis manuscript tells of a man, Severin von Kusiemski, who is so infatuated with a woman, Wanda von Dunajew, that he asks to be her slave, and encourages her to treat him in progressively more degrading ways. At first Wanda does not understand or accede to the request, but after humouring Severin a bit she finds the advantages of the method to be interesting and enthusiastically embraces the idea, although at the same time she disdains Severin for allowing her to do so.\nSeverin describes his feelings during these experiences as suprasensuality. Severin and Wanda travel to Florence. Along the way, Severin takes the generic Russian servant's name of \"Gregor\" and the role of Wanda's servant. In Florence, Wanda treats him brutally as a servant, and recruits a trio of African women to dominate him.\nThe relationship arrives at a crisis when Wanda herself meets a man to whom she would like to submit, a Byronic hero known as Alexis Papadopolis. At the end of the book, Severin, humiliated by Wanda's new lover, loses the desire to submit. He says of Wanda:\nThat woman, as nature has created her, and man at present is educating her, is man's enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot, but never his companion.

Her father is the captain of a sailing schooner, and her constant companion is Cap'n Bill Weedles, a retired sailor with a wooden leg. (Cap'n Bill had been Trot's father's skipper, and Charlie Griffiths had been his mate, before the accident that took the older man's leg.) Trot and Cap'n Bill spend many of their days roaming the beaches near home, or rowing and sailing along the coast. One day, Trot wishes that she could see a mermaid; her wish is overheard, and granted the next day. The mermaids explain to Trot, and the distressed Cap'n Bill, that they are benevolent fairies; when they offer Trot a chance to pay a visit to their land in mermaid form, Trot is enthusiastic, and Bill is too loyal to let her go off without him.\nSo begins their sojourn among the sea fairies. They see amazing sights in the land of Queen Aquarine and King Anko (including an octopus who is mortified to learn that he's the symbol of the Standard Oil Company). They also encounter a villain called Zog the Magician, a monstrous hybrid of man, animal, and fish. Zog and his sea devils capture them and hold them prisoner. The two protagonists discover that many sailors thought to have been drowned have actually been captured and enslaved by Zog. Trot and Cap'n Bill survive Zog's challenges, and the villain is eventually defeated by the forces of good. Trot and Cap'n Bill are returned to human form, safe and dry after their undersea adventure.\nAs many readers and critics have observed, Baum's Oz in particular and his fantasy novels in general are dominated by puissant and virtuous female figures; the archetype of the father-figure plays little role in Baum's fantasy world.

Production manager Hugh Perceval (Michael Kitchen) tells Colin that there are no jobs available, but he decides to wait for Olivier, whom he once met at a party. Olivier and his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond), eventually show up and Vivien encourages Olivier to give Colin a job on his upcoming film The Prince and the Showgirl, starring Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). Colin's first task is to find a suitable place for Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), to stay at while they are in England. The press find out about the house, but Colin reveals he secured a second house just in case, impressing Olivier and Marilyn's publicist, Arthur P. Jacobs (Toby Jones).\nThe paparazzi find out about Marilyn's arrival at Heathrow and they gather around the plane when it lands. Marilyn brings her husband, her business partner, Milton H. Greene (Dominic Cooper), and her acting coach Paula Strasberg (Zo\u0102\u0164 Wanamaker) with her. She initially appears to be uncomfortable around the many photographers, but relaxes at the press conference. Olivier becomes frustrated when Marilyn is late to the read-through. She insists Paula sits with her and when she has trouble with her lines, Paula reads them for her. The crew and the other actors, including Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), are in awe of Marilyn. Colin meets Lucy (Emma Watson), a wardrobe assistant to whom he is attracted, and they go on a date. Marilyn starts arriving later to the set and often forgets her lines, angering Olivier. However, Sybil praises Marilyn and defends her when Olivier tries to get her to apologise for holding the shoot up.\nMarilyn struggles to understand her character and leaves the set when Olivier insults her. Colin asks the director to be more sympathetic towards Marilyn, before he goes to Parkside House to check on her. He hears an argument and finds a tearful Marilyn sitting on the stairs with Arthur's notebook, which contains the plot of a new play that appears to poke fun at her. Arthur later returns to the United States. Vivien comes to the set and watches some of Marilyn's scenes. She breaks down, saying Marilyn lights up the screen and if only Olivier could see himself when he watches her. Olivier tries unsuccessfully to reassure his wife. Marilyn does not show up to the set following Arthur's departure and she asks Colin to come to Parkside and they talk. The crew becomes captivated by Marilyn when she dances for a scene and Milton pulls Colin aside to tell him Marilyn breaks hearts and that she will break his too. Lucy also notices Colin's growing infatuation with Marilyn and breaks up with him.\nColin and Marilyn spend the day together and are given a tour of the library of Windsor Castle by Owen Morshead (Derek Jacobi). Colin also shows Marilyn around Eton College, and they go skinny dipping in the River Thames. Marilyn kisses Colin and they are found by Roger Smith (Philip Jackson), Marilyn's bodyguard. Colin is called to Parkside one night as Marilyn has locked herself in her room. Colin enters her room and Marilyn invites him to lie next to her on the bed. The following night, Marilyn wakes up in pain and claims she is having a miscarriage. A doctor tends to her and Marilyn tells Colin that Arthur is coming back and she wants to try and be a good wife to him, so she and Colin should forget everything that happened between them. She later returns to the set to complete the film. Olivier praises Marilyn, but reveals she has killed his desire to direct again. Lucy asks Colin if Marilyn broke his heart and he replies that she did, to which she replies that he needed it. Marilyn comes to a local pub, where Colin is staying, and thanks him for helping her. She kisses him goodbye and Roger drives her to the airport.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Vivian Leigh"}], "question": "Who encouraged Laurence Olivier to hire Colin Clark to

(Drew Barrymore) is an insecure copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times who has never had a real relationship. One day, her editor-in-chief, Rigfort (Garry Marshall) assigns her to report undercover at a high school to help parents become more aware of their children's lives.\nHer first day at South Glen South High School is miserable. Josie reverts to the old geek persona that ruined her first high school career. She also has an unfortunate run-in with three obnoxious popular girls (Jordan Ladd, Jessica Alba, and Marley Shelton), and Guy Perkins (Jeremy Jordan), the school's most attractive, popular student. Josie loses hope, but is reassured when a kind-hearted nerd named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski) befriends her. Aldys, who loathes Guy and his gang, invites Josie to join The Denominators, a group of intelligent students.\nJosie develops a crush on her English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), and becomes the top student in his class. After reciting a romantic excerpt from Shakespeare to Sam, Josie has horrible flashbacks to when she read a romantic poem aloud in class to her high school crush, a popular boy named Billy Prince (Denny Kirkwood), who later asked her to their senior prom, making her dream come true. However, on the night of the prom, Billy arrives with another girl and both of them hurl eggs and insults at Josie, humiliating her and breaking her heart.\nOne night while out driving with Aldys, Josie encounters Guy and his gang at a local hangout called \"The Court\" where promiscuity and underage drinking take place. Her managing editor Augustus \"Gus\" Strauss (John C. Reilly) loses patience with Josie after a rival paper scoops The Court story, and orders Josie to become friends with the popular kids. He arranges for her to wear a hidden camera, and soon the whole office becomes obsessed with her story.\nJosie confides in her brother Rob (David Arquette) about her fears. Rob, who was their high school's most popular boy in his teens, urges her to let go of her old self and start anew. To help her, Rob enrolls as a student and becomes an instant hit. He then uses his influence to draw Josie into the cool crowd, much to the dismay of Aldys.\nSam and Josie grow closer, but Sam struggles with his feelings as he thinks she's a student. Guy and Josie attend the prom as Rosalind and Orlando from Shakespeare's As You Like It. Anita, Gus and Josie's other co-workers watch through the camera and are overjoyed as she is voted prom queen. As Guy dances with Aldys as an alleged act of friendship, the mean girls attempt to dump dog food over Aldys. Outraged, Josie throws her crown away and reveals her true identity. She praises Aldys for her kindness and warns the students that one's persona in high school means nothing in the real world. Sam is hurt by her lies and states he wants nothing to do with her. Also angered is Rob, who as a phony student received a second chance at baseball. Josie, ultimately making amends, secures him a coaching job.\nJosie vows to give Gus a story and writes an account of her experience. In it, she admits she's never been kissed, describes the students of South Glen South, and avows her love for Sam; the entire city is moved by it. She writes she will stand in the middle of the baseball field and wait for Sam to come and kiss her. Josie waits, but the clock runs out with no sign of Sam.

17-year-old girl living in Ojai, California lies to her best friend Rhiannon Abernathy about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhiannon's hippie parents. Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to Natasha Bedingfield's \"Pocketful of Sunshine\", which is played by a greeting card she was sent. The following Monday, pressed by Rhiannon, Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy. Marianne Bryant, a prissy and strictly religious Christian at their school, overhears her telling the lie and soon it spreads like wildfire. The school's conservative church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project. Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, and he explains how others bully him because of his homosexuality. He later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone as a 'straight stud'.\nBrandon convinces Olive to help him and they pretend to have sex at a party. After having a fight with Rhiannon over Olive's new identity as a \"dirty skank\", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp. She begins to wear more provocative clothing and stitches a red \"A\" to everything she wears. Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past beg Olive to say they have had sex with her in order to increase their own popularity, in exchange for gift cards to various stores, in turn increasing her reputation. Things get worse when Micah, Marianne's 22-year-old boyfriend, contracts chlamydia from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith, the school guidance counsellor, and blames it all on Olive. Olive agrees to lie to cover up the affair so that the marriage of her favorite teacher, Mr. Griffith, would be spared.\nMarianne's religious clique, which now includes Rhiannon, begins harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school. After an ill-fated date with Anson, a boy who wants to pay her to actually sleep with him and not just pretend she did, Olive reconnects with Todd, her old crush, who is also the school's mascot. Todd then tells her that he does not believe the rumors because he remembers when she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago. Olive then begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town and everyone else is enjoying their newfound popularity and do not want the truth to get out. Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth and when Olive threatens to expose her, Mrs. Griffith rebuffs her, saying no one would believe her.\nOlive, out of spite, then immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who believes her and separates from Mrs. Griffith. After a friendly talk with her eccentric, open-minded mother Rosemary, Olive comes up with a plan to get everything finally out in the open. She then does a song and dance number at a school pep rally to get people's attention to watch her via web cam, where she confesses what she has done (the web cam is the framing device of the film). The various boys whose reputations Olive helped improve are also shown watching. Later, Olive texts Rhiannon, apologizing for lying to her.

Her mother is eventually transported to America, and Moll Flanders (not her birth name, she emphasises, taking care not to reveal it) is raised until adolescence by a goodly foster mother. Thereafter she gets attached to a household as a servant where she is loved by both sons, the elder of whom convinces her to \"act like they were married\" in bed. Unwilling to marry her, he persuades her to marry his younger brother. After five years of marriage, she then is widowed, leaves her children in the care of in-laws, and begins honing the skill of passing herself off as a fortuned widow to attract a man who will marry her and provide her with security.\nThe first time she does this, her \"gentleman-tradesman\" spendthrift husband goes bankrupt and flees to the Continent, leaving her on her own with his blessing to do the best she can to forget him. (They had one child together, but he died.) The second time, she makes a match that leads her to Virginia with a kindly man who introduces her to his mother. After three children (one dies), Moll learns that her mother-in-law is actually her biological mother, which makes her husband her half-brother. She dissolves their marriage and after continuing to live with her brother for three years, travels back to England, leaving her two children behind, and goes to live in Bath to seek a new husband.\nAgain she returns to her con skills and develops a relationship with a man in Bath whose wife is elsewhere confined due to insanity. Their relationship is at first platonic, but eventually develops into Moll becoming something of a \"kept woman\" in Hammersmith, London. They have three children (one lives), but after a severe illness he repents, breaks off the arrangement, and commits to his wife.\nMoll, now 42, resorts to another beau, a banker Callum Murray, who while still married to an adulterous wife (a \"whore\"), proposes to Moll after she entrusts him with her herd of cattle. While waiting for Callum to divorce, Moll pretends to have a great fortune to attract another wealthy husband Samuel. She becomes involved with some Roman Catholics in Lancashire that try to convert her, and she marries one of them, a supposedly rich man Bretton. She soon realises he expected to receive a great herd of cattle which she denies having, leading him to admit that he has cheated her into marriage, having himself lied about having money that he does not possess. He is in fact a ruined gentleman and discharges her from the marriage, telling her nevertheless that she should inherit any money he might ever get (finally, she mentions his name). Although now pregnant again, Moll lets the banker believe she is available, hoping he returns. She gives birth and the midwife gives a tripartite scale of the costs of bearing a child, with one value level per social class.\nMoll's son is born when the banker's wife commits suicide following their divorce, and Moll leaves her newborn in the care of a countrywoman in exchange for the sum of \u00c2\u01415 a year. Moll marries the banker now, but realises \"what an abominable creature I am! and how this innocent gentleman is going to be abused by me!\" They live in happiness for five years before he becomes bankrupt and dies of despair, the fate of their two children left unstated.\nTruly desperate now, Moll begins a career of artful thievery, which, by employing her wits, beauty, charm, and femininity, as well as hard-heartedness and wickedness, brings her the financial security she has always sought. She assumes the name Moll Flanders and is known thereby. She is helped throughout her career as a thief by her Governess, who also acts as receiver. During this time she briefly becomes the mistress of a man she robbed, and is finally caught by two maids whilst trying to steal from a house.\nIn Newgate she is led to her repentance. At the same time, she reunites with her soulmate, her \"Lancashire husband\", who is also jailed for his robberies (before and after they first met, he acknowledges). Moll is found guilty of felony, but not burglary, the second charge; still, the sentence is death in any case. Yet Moll convinces a minister of her repentance, and together with her Lancashire husband is sent to the Colonies to avoid hanging, where they live happily together (she even talks the ship's captain into not being with the convicts sold upon arrival, but instead in the captain's quarters). Once in the colonies, Moll learns her mother has left her a plantation and that her own son (by her brother) is alive, as is her brother/husband.\nMoll carefully introduces herself to her brother and their son, in disguise. With the help of a Quaker, the two found a farm with 50 servants in Maryland. Moll reveals herself now to her son in Virginia and he gives her her mother's inheritance, a farm for which he will now be her steward, providing \u00c2\u0141100 a year income for her. In turn, she makes him her heir and gives him a (stolen) gold watch.\nAt last, her life of conniving and desperation seems to be over. When her brother/husband is dead, Moll tells her (Lancashire) husband the entire story and he is \"perfectly easy on that account... For, said he, it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it was a mistake impossible to be prevented\". Aged 69 (in 1683), the two return to England to live \"in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Newgate Prison, London"}], "question": "In which prison was Moll's mother imprisoned?", "id": "924b3fef8301b7c25f882fa5b6f8f27a8a906f48"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she was pregnant"}], "question": "Why was Moll's mother given a repreive from her sentence in prison?", "id": "924b3fef8301b7c25f882fa5b6f8f27a8a906f48"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Foster mother in America"}], "question": "Who raises Moll Flanders, and in which country?", "id": "924b3fef8301b7c25f882fa5b6f8f27a8a906f48"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Younger brother"}], "question": "Which of the brothers in the household marry Moll Flanders?

where Kyle is brash and outspoken, Adam is more introverted and mild-mannered.\nAfter experiencing harsh pains in his back, Adam learns from his doctor that he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma (a malignant tumor) in his spine, and must undergo chemotherapy. He sees on the Internet that his chances of survival are fifty-fifty. After Adam reveals his diagnosis, his overbearing mother, Diane, who already cares for her husband Richard suffering from Alzheimer's, wants to move in and care for him. Adam rejects this offer, as Rachael has promised to be the one to take care of him. Rachael, however, is \"uncomfortable\" going into the hospital during Adam's chemo treatments and is often late to pick him up, as Adam doesn't drive; she also gets him a retired racing greyhound named Skeletor as a companion animal. Throughout Adam's struggle, Kyle attempts to keep Adam's spirits high, which include helping Adam shave his head prior to chemotherapy and openly using Adam's illness to pick up women. While on a date with one such woman, however, Kyle sees Rachael at an art gallery, kissing another man, and forces her to come clean to Adam; this proves to be the final straw in their already strained relationship, and Adam breaks up with her for good. Now single, he eventually starts to follow Kyle's lead, and the two use his illness to successfully pick up two women at a bar.\nMeanwhile, Adam skeptically begins going to a young and inexperienced therapist, Katherine McKay (Kendrick), a PhD candidate doing the clinical aspect of her thesis at the hospital. Although their relationship and sessions have a rocky start, he slowly begins to open up to her about his disease and how it is affecting him. After she gives him a lift home in her car after one of his chemo sessions, the two develop a rapport both in and outside of their sessions, which begins to blur the lines of both their doctor-patient relationship and connection as friends. She helps Adam understand his mother's situation as well, that even though he is the cancer patient, the loved ones feel just as much stress watching someone they care about fight the disease, which helps Adam make steps in repairing the rift between him and his mother. During chemo treatments, Adam also befriends Alan (Hall) and Mitch (Frewer), two older cancer patients who are also undergoing chemotherapy. The two offer Adam advice and smoke marijuana with him.\nAfter Mitch suddenly dies, Adam's fears of his own potential death and unknown future become more evident. Subsequently, he is informed that his treatment is not working and that he needs to undertake a risky surgery as a last resort. The night before his surgery, Adam has an argument with Kyle and demands to drive Kyle's car because Kyle is drunk\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though Adam does not have a driver's license. After nearly causing an accident, Adam breaks down and criticizes Kyle for seemingly not taking his illness seriously and using it for his own ends. Adam calls Katherine and tells her that he wishes he had a girlfriend like her, but also says he is tired and just wants it to be over. That night, Adam stays at Kyle's and while in the bathroom washing his hands, he finds a book entitled 'Facing Cancer Together' from their first trip to a bookstore where Kyle picked up the shop clerk\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is filled with notes, highlighted paragraphs and turned-down pages, proving to Adam that Kyle does sincerely care about Adam's struggle and has been helping him the best way he knows how, by simply not treating Adam any differently throughout the duration of his illness.\nThe next day when Kyle drops Adam off at the hospital, Adam embraces Kyle for being a good friend and apologizes for what he said the previous night. After Adam says what could be his final farewells to his family, he undergoes his surgery. During the wait, Katherine goes to the waiting room where she inadvertently meets Adam's family and Kyle. After the surgery, Kyle, Diane, and Katherine are told by the doctor that although the bone degradation was worse than they had thought, the tumor was removed successfully, and that Adam would recover.\nSome time later, Adam is getting ready for a date with Katherine, while Kyle encourages him and cleans the incision on Adam's back from the surgery. The doorbell rings and Adam lets Katherine inside. After Kyle leaves, Katherine asks, \"Now what?,\" and Adam simply smiles - at last being free of cancer.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Kyle"}], "question": "Who is Adam's best

On his way to school, he hides from the bullies in a bookstore, interrupting the grumpy bookseller, Mr. Coreander. Bastian asks about one of the books he sees, but Mr. Coreander advises against it. His curiosity piqued, Bastian seizes the book, leaving a note promising to return it, and hides in the school's attic to read. The book describes the world of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a force called \"The Nothing\". Fantasia's ruler, the Childlike Empress, has fallen ill, and Atreyu is tasked to discover the cure, believing that once the Empress is well, the Nothing will no longer be a threat. Atreyu is given a medallion named the AURYN that can guide and protect him in the quest. As Atreyu sets out, the Nothing summons Gmork, a wolf-like creature, to kill Atreyu.\nAtreyu's quest directs him to the advisor Morla the Ancient One in the Swamps of Sadness. Though the AURYN protects Atreyu, his beloved horse Artax is lost to the swamp, and he continues alone. Later, Atreyu is surprised by the sudden appearance of Morla, a giant turtle. Bastian, reading, is also surprised and lets out a scream, which Atreyu and Morla appear to hear. Morla does not have the answers Atreyu seeks, but directs him to the Southern Oracle, ten thousand miles distant. Atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the Swamps but is saved by the luckdragon Falkor (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer). Falkor takes him to the home of two gnomes that live near the entrance to the Southern Oracle. The gnomes explain that Atreyu will face various trials before reaching the Oracle. Atreyu proceeds to enter the Oracle, and is perplexed when one second trial, a mirror that shows the viewer's true self, reveals a boy which Bastian recognizes as himself. Bastian throws the book aside, but after catching his breath, continues to read. Atreyu eventually meets the Southern Oracle who tells him the only way to save the Empress is to find a human child to give her a new name, beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.\nAtreyu and Falkor flee before the Nothing consumes the Southern Oracle. In flight, Atreyu is knocked from Falkor's back into the Sea of Possibilities, losing the AURYN in the process. He wakes on the shore of the abandoned ruins, and finds a series of paintings depicting his quest. Gmork reveals himself, having been lying in wait and explains that Fantasia represents humanity's imagination, and that the Nothing represents adult apathy and cynicism against it. Atreyu fends off and kills Gmork as the Nothing begins to consume the ruins. Falkor, who had managed to locate AURYN, rescues Atreyu in time. The two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of Fantasia remaining, and fear they have failed when they spot the Empress's Ivory Tower among the fragment. Inside, Atreyu apologizes for failing the Empress, but she assures him he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest. As the Nothing begins to consume the Tower, the Empress pleas directly to Bastian to call out her new name. Bastian calls out the name he had selected, and loses consciousness.\nWhen he wakes, he finds himself in blackness with the Empress, with only a grain of sand the last bit of Fantasia remaining. The Empress tells Bastian that he has the power to bring Fantasia back with his imagination using the power of the AURYN. Bastian re-creates Fantasia, and as he flies on Falkor's back, he sees the land and its inhabitants restored, and that Atreyu has been reunited with Artax. When Falkor tells him he can wish for anything, Bastian then brings Falkor back to the real world to chase down the bullies from before. The film ends with the narration that Bastian had many more wishes and adventures, and adds: \"but that's another story\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Coreander"}],

The couple are the parents of six young rabbits generally called The Flopsy Bunnies. Benjamin and Flopsy are \"very improvident and cheerful\" and have some difficulty feeding their brood. At times, they turn to Peter Rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but there are days when Peter cannot spare cabbages. It is then that the Flopsy Bunnies cross the field to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables.\nOne day they find and feast on lettuces that have shot into flower, and, under their \"soporific\" influence, fall asleep in the rubbish heap, though Benjamin puts a sack over his head. Mr. McGregor discovers them by accident when tipping grass-clippings down and places them in a sack and ties it shut then sets the sack aside while attending to another matter. Benjamin and Flopsy are unable to help their children, but a \"resourceful\" wood mouse called Thomasina Tittlemouse, gnaws a hole in the sack and the bunnies escape. Their parents fill the sack with rotten vegetables, and the animals hide under a bush to observe Mr. McGregor's reaction.\nMr. McGregor does not notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, continually counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them, but when she reaches into the sack and discovers the rotten vegetables she becomes very, very, angry and accuses her husband of playing a trick on her. And then, Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting the youngest of the eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.\nScholar M. Daphne Kutzer points out that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two previous rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, he is still a frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.", "qas":

But an old and corrupt Centaurian Empire is holding Terra down, as it encircles the Terran system and will not let the humans grow out of their current empire. For this reason Terra is at war with Proxima Centauri and is trying to find a way of breaking free from the Centaurian's hold upon them.\nIn the war that results, Terra is continually coming up with new weapons to try and break the Centaurian defenses, but Proxima Centauri is also continually updating its defenses. Using spies and other such tactics, both parties find out about each other's advances, and no actual fighting ever occurs because both sides are too busy trying to beat each other with new technological developments. Terra even calculates their chances to win a war versus Centauri and updates these calculations with each new development, making their decision about a war rely on this calculation. Eventually Terra comes up with a concept for a bomb, called Icarus, that Proxima can not defend against because it travels at faster than light speeds, making use of the buildup of mass at near light speeds as a destructive agent when it slows down to below light speed. Then the odds start to side with Terra, and Terra prepares to fight with this new-found technology. There are two problems 1) is that Icarus does not yet work which prevents Terra from using it against Proxima Centuari and 2) that the existence of Cole on Terra is an \"unknown variable\" that confuses the war win probability computer. Hence the book title \"The Variable Man\".\nThis is where Thomas Cole, known as The Variable Man, comes in. Cole is a man from the past, from 1913, the time just before the First World War. He is brought into the present (or future depending on perspective) as an accident via a Time Bubble that was used for research about the past. He escapes from the authority in the future and spends a lot of time running from them afterwards. It is, however, discovered that this man has a certain genius to fix things and make things work. This is because he comes out of a period of time when humans had a natural genius and an ability to invent things and to solve problems. It is at this point that the man working on the FTL (Faster Than Light) bomb realizes that The Variable Man is the only person who can make Icarus work. As a result, the engineer working on Icarus convinces The Variable Man to help them out. Icarus does eventually work, although not in the way that anyone may have wanted. Instead of emerging from FTL speed in the middle of Centarus (the sun around which the Centaurian Empire is built) and blowing it, and the surrounding Centaurian system, out of existence, it turns out that Cole transformed (or fixed) Icarus into a working hyperdrive. However the order for Terra to launch a full-scale attack against the Centaurian Empire (under the assumption that the majority of the enemy ships and planets would have been destroyed in the Icarus explosion) had already been given. The forces of Terra suffered a terrible defeat, losing many of their ships, yet due to the Variable Man having successfully wired Icarus it was now possible for Terra to travel beyond the Centaurian Empire's perimeter. Terra was no longer blocked into their tiny system, and there was no further need for war.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they will not give Terra the room to expand their empire."}], "question": "Why is Terra at war with Proxima Centauri?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Each side is more concerned with advancing their technology to be more powerful than the other."}], "question": "What prevents either side from actually fighting during the war?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Icarus."}], "question": "What is the name of the unbeatable bomb that Terra develops?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It travels at faster than light speeds."}], "question": "What makes the Icarus bomb unbeatable?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Thomas Cole."}], "question": "What is the name of the man who is from 1913?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he is from another time, and messes up the predictions of the war win probability computer."}], "question": "Why is Thomas Cole called the Variable Man?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He rewires it to be a hyperdrive instead of a bomb."}], "question": "What does Cole do to the Icarus bomb when he is asked to make it work?", "id": "9562ea781e95c048df96f528a2a8272721cde3a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By giving the Terrans the ability to travel past the Centaurians.

It does not help that Rodriguez has outstanding gambling debts, and that a loan shark known only as \"Mr. Cutlass Supreme\" (Tiny Lister) is on his case for it. After arresting numerous felons without success (because they cannot possibly link Hudd's murder to any of them), Divinci and Rodriguez arrest a homeless drunk by the name of Joe Doe (Dennis Quaid). While Joe is still intoxicated, the detectives convince him that he shot Hudd. They even make him sign a confession. Divinci and Rodriguez convince local stripper Cynthia Webb (Lela Rochon), also Divinci's mistress, who was the \"bait\" in their trap for Hudd, to \"identify\" Joe in a police line-up.\nAt his first legal hearing, Joe is declared mentally unfit to stand trial (he can not even remember his own last name). The trial is postponed accordingly. Really believing that he killed Hudd, Joe informs his attorney that he deserves to be in jail and is willing to accept a plea bargain. Meanwhile, it turns out that the Magnum that Rodruiguez stole from the police-evidence room to kill Hudd is that of Clyde David Dunner, a murderer and arsonist arrested by Divinci and Rodruiguez and whose case is currently being tried. To fill the void, Divinci gets another gun to replace the other, but during trial Dunner recognizes that this one is not his gun and the case is dropped for lack of evidence.\nAt Joe's second hearing, high-profile lawyer Arthur Baylor (James Earl Jones) attends the proceedings. Baylor reveals that his client's name is actually William Dane McCall, and that he is actually the missing-and-presumed-dead co-heir to the financial empire of a high-status family, as well as a surgeon who used to attend and help the poor. Baylor asks the court to grant a one-week continuance so he can prepare his defense properly. The court agrees. Afterwards, Cynthia is summoned to testify in court. Nervous and afraid, she disappears. Divinci, fearing that she may betray him, hires a bail agent named Manny (Terrence C. Carson) to locate her; when Manny's efforts fail, he is roughed up by Divinci and Rodriguez. Cynthia is finally discovered and brought in for The People vs. William Dane McCall. She gives her rehearsed testimony against \"Joe\", at which time William informs Baylor that he lived in an alley next to Cynthia's apartment. Baylor questions Cynthia and points to the contradictions in her testimony until she finally confesses to knowing \"Joe\". The fact that she knows the defendant as \"Joe\" and not as \"William Dane McCall\" shows that she had previous knowledge of the defendant, thus proving her testimony for \"Joe\" being Hudd's killer to be false. She is arrested for perjury while the verdict of William's case remains pending. Divinci hires Manny to get Cynthia out of jail. He plans to kill her before she can testify.\nOn their way to \"silence\" her, Rodriguez tells Divinci how he feels regarding the numerous murders they have committed. Divinci suddenly suspects his partner of taping their conversation; such indeed turns out to be the case, after Divinci forcibly searches Rodriguez. Rodriguez informs Divinci that he has already confessed to the DEA regarding what they have done. Unwilling to kill Rodriguez here and now, Divinci renounces their friendship and drives off into the night. Rodriguez returns home to find his bookie and Mr. Cutlass Supreme waiting for him. Enraged about the preceding events, he attacks them only to be shot dead. Cynthia is brought to court by Baylor, who strikes a deal with her to testify against Divinci and thus get her perjury case dropped.\nFour months later, Frank has become a fugitive. Knowing that Cynthia blew the whistle on him, he breaks into her home. He takes her money, then shoots and badly wounds her. Cynthia is rushed to an emergency room at the local hospital, where Doctor William Dane McCall prepares to operate to save her life.\nDivinci forces Manny to help smuggle him out of the country. Manny hires a luxurious car and a driver for Frank. Unfortunately for Divinci, said driver turns out to be Clyde David Dunner...who produces the same revolver used to kill Hudd. He shoots Frank in the head, then abandons the car and body in a deserted alley.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Frank Davinci and Jake Rodriguez"}], "question": "What are the

and exhibits several instances of temporal disruption. A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key.\nIn what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.\nTrying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn\". They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to the set of a film called The Sylvia North Story, directed by Adam, where Camilla Rhodes gives an audition and Adam declares, \"This is the girl.\" Betty smiles shyly as she locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying that she is late to meet a friend.\nBetty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. The two women have sex that night and awake at 2 a.m., when Rita insists they go to an eerie theater called Club Silencio. On stage, a man explains in several languages that everything is an illusion; a woman begins singing then collapses, although her vocals continue. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with a thump.\nThe older red-headed woman investigates the sound, but nothing is there. The Cowboy appears in the doorway of Diane Selwyn's bedroom saying, \"Hey, pretty girl. Time to wake up.\" At this point, all elements of the narrative seem to change. Diane Selwyn (played by Watts) wakes up in her bed. She looks exactly like Betty, but is portrayed as a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her unrequited love for Camilla Rhodes (played now by Harring). On Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. Her limousine stops before they reach the house and Camilla escorts her using a shortcut. Adam appears to be in love with Camilla. Over dinner, Diane states that she came to Hollywood when her aunt died, and she met Camilla at an audition for The Sylvia North Story. Another woman (played by George) kisses Camilla and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, and dissolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying.\nDiane meets with the hit man at Winkies, where she gives him Camilla's photo and a large amount of money, and they are served by a waitress named Betty. The hit man tells Diane that when the job is done, she will find a blue key. Diane asks what, if anything, the key opens, but the hit man just laughs. Diane looks up and sees the man who had the nightmare standing at the counter. Back at her apartment, with the key on a table in front of her, she is terrorized by hallucinations. She runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself. A woman at the club whispers \"Silencio\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\"Rita\" sees a Rita Hayworth poster."}], "question": "Why does \"Rita\" adopt this particular assumed name?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rita was injured in a car crash on Mulholland drive."}], "question": "Why has \"Rita\" forgotten her own name?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Adam is being threatened to do so by mobsters."}], "question": "Why does Adam Kesher cast unknown Camilla Rhodes as Sylvia North?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rita and Betty find a dead woman."}], "question": "What do \"Rita\" and Betty find in Diane Selwyns apartment?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diane had come after the death of her aunt."}], "question": "Why did Diane claim she had come to Hollywood?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Camilla invites her."}], "question": "Why does Diane go to the party on Mulholland Drive?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diane is in love with Camilla."}], "question": "Why is Diane upset to see Camilla kissing other people?", "id": "999a532b45f030c8f382f0f92fc51b3d12fd821c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Diane will find a blue key.

The fictional town of Plassans (loosely based on the real city of Aix-en-Provence, where Zola grew up) is established as the setting for the novel and described in intimate detail, and then we are introduced to the eccentric heroine Adelaide Fouque, later known as \"Tante Dide\", who becomes the common ancestor for both the Rougon and Macquart families. Her legitimate son from her short marriage to her late husband, a labourer named Rougon who worked on Dide's land, is forced to grow up alongside two illegitimate children \u2014 a boy and a girl \u2014 from Dide's later romance with the smuggler, poacher and alcoholic Macquart, while the ageing Dide slides further and further into a state of mental illness and borderline senile dementia. From this premise, the next nineteen novels all get their central protagonists and to a certain extent their themes.\nThe narrative continues along double lines, following both \"branches\" of the family. We see Pierre Rougon (the legitimate son) in his attempts to disinherit his Macquart half-siblings, his marriage to Felicit\u00e9 Puech, the voraciously ambitious daughter of a local merchant, and their continued failure to establish the fortune, fame and renown they seek, despite their greed and relatively comfortable lifestyles. Approaching old age, the Rougon couple finally admit defeat and settle, crushed, into their lower middle class destinies, until by a remarkable stroke of luck their eldest son Eug\u00e8ne reports from Paris that he has some news that they might find interesting. Eug\u00e8ne has become one of the closest allies of the future Emperor Napoleon III and informs his parents that a coup is imminent. Having been effectively given insider information about which side to back in the coming revolution, the Rougons then make a series of seemingly bold moves to show their loyal and steadfast support for Napoleon III, winning the admiration of the most influential people in the town, mostly royalists who are themselves afraid of showing too much commitment for fear of backing the \"wrong horse\" and losing their standing and fortune.\nThe narrative then switches over to the Macquart side of the family, whose grim working-class struggles to survive are juxtaposed keenly with the Rougons' seemingly trivial quest for greater wealth and influence in genteel drawing-room society. Descended from a drunken ne'er-do-well and a madwoman, Zola effectively predestines the Macquarts to lives of toil and misery. Zola's theories of heredity, laid out in the original preface to this novel, were a cornerstone of his entire philosophy and a major reason for his embarking on the mammoth Rougon-Macquart project in the first place in order to illustrate them. Largely discredited nowadays, the theories are largely \"present but unseen\" in most of the novels in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, allowing those books to be enjoyed without the overshadowing effect of Zola's somewhat suspect scientific ideas. Due to the original story nature of La Fortune des Rougon, the theories are placed much more to the fore, and can appear somewhat heavy-handed as a result.\nA third branch of the family, the Mourets, descended from Macquart and Dide's daughter, are then introduced before the novel's focus is brought back to the \"present\", the night of the coup, via a quite brilliantly told love story. The idealistic but na\u00efve Silv\u00e8re Mouret falls madly in love with the innocent Miette Chantegreil, and after a long courtship they decide to join up with the republicans to fight the coup. The rest of the novel then picks up from where the opening chapter left off, and from then on is basically a dual narrative telling the story of the old Rougon couple and their increasingly Machiavellian machinations to get themselves into a position of fortune and respect in Plassans, juxtaposed with Silv\u00e8re and Miette's continuing love story and the doomed republican militia's disastrous attempt to take the town back. Eventually, the Rougons exploit their half-brother Antoine Macquart into inadvertently helping crush the republican threat, and they achieve their life's ambition, fortune and favour. For Silv\u00e8re and Miette, who committed themselves so completely to a doomed cause, there can be no such happy ending and Zola wisely leaves their half of the story at a bleak dead end..", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aix-en-Provence, where Zola grew up"}], "question": "What is the fictional city of Plassons based upon?", "id": "9a1e1983016459fb1b0393306e408d85d2d4a5bb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The matriarch, Dide, had a son from a legitimate marriage and 2 children from an illegitimate marriage"}], "question": "Why does the family have 2 branches?", "id": "9a1e1983016459fb1b0393306e408d85d2d4a5bb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Rougons are social climbers, attempting to better their already quite good position in society, and are not above cheating others.

American West. Blanco Posnet, a local drunk and reprobate, is brought before the court accused of stealing a horse belonging to the Sheriff. He been found walking along a road out of town after having left his brother's house in the early hours of the morning. The same night the horse had gone missing from his brother's stable. His accusers assume he has sold or concealed the horse. Blanco says they can't convict him without evidence that he ever had the horse. He also says he was owed some jewellery belonging to his mother, which had been bequeathed to him, but his brother had refused to hand it over. Even if he did take the horse he did so as payment for the debt his brother owed. Unfortunately he was unaware that the horse was merely being stabled by his brother, but belonged to the Sheriff. His brother, a reformed drunkard who is now a church Deacon, lectures Blanco on morality and judgement, but Blanco ridicules his brother's view of God.\nFeemy, the local prostitute, is called to witness. She says that she saw Blanco riding off on the horse. Blanco says that her word cannot be trusted, as she is a woman of low character and she admits was drunk at the time; in any case she has a grudge against him because - unlike members of the jury he can name - he had no interest in her services. The jury are outraged and strongly inclined to convict Blanco. At this point news arrives that the horse has been found. A woman had used it to take her sick child to the nearest doctor. The woman is brought to the court. She says she was given the horse by a man who was about to pass her on it on the road as she was carrying her dying child. She had pleaded with the man to allow her to take the horse. The judge asks her to name the man, but she absolutely denies that Blanco was the man who gave her the horse. She says that the man who did give it to her evidently did so in the knowledge that on foot he would probably be caught and could be hanged. It is clear to everyone that Blanco gave her the horse, but she cannot bring herself to name him if it will mean his conviction and inevitable hanging. Feemy takes the stand again and says she was lying about having seen Blanco. She never saw him on the horse. Blanco is released. He offers to marry Feemy in thanks for what she did, but she rejects him. Blanco says he'll buy drinks for everyone in the saloon and offers to shake Feemy's hand.

extremely wealthy father, Alexander, who wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows that Westley is really only interested in her money. Jumping ship in Florida, she runs away, boarding a bus to New York City to reunite with her new spouse, when she meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter. Soon Warne recognizes her and gives her a choice: If she will give him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees to the first choice.\nAs they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love. When they have to hitchhike, Peter fails to draw attention until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop en route, Danker tries to steal their luggage, but Peter seizes his car. Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, and agrees to have a second, formal wedding to Westley.\nOn her wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story.

When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior, Peter admits he loves Ellie, and storms out.

1751, outside the British Linen Company in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nThe first part of the book recounts the attempts of the hero, David Balfour, to gain justice for James Stewart (James of the Glens), who has been arrested and charged with complicity in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer and goes on to meet William Grant of Prestongrange, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to press the case for James' innocence. However, his attempts fail as - after being reunited with Alan Breck - he is once again kidnapped and, this time, confined on the Bass Rock, an island in the Firth of Forth, until the trial is over, and James condemned to death. David also meets and falls in love with Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the daughter of James MacGregor Drummond, known as James More (who was Rob Roy's eldest son), also held in prison, whose escape she engineers. David also receives some education in the manners and morals of polite society from Barbara Grant, Prestongrange's daughter.\nIn the second part, David and Catriona travel to Holland, where David studies law at the University of Leyden. David takes Catriona under his protection (she having no money) until her father finds them. James More eventually arrives and proves something of a disappointment, drinking a great deal and showing no compunction against living off David's largesse. At this time, David learns of the death of his uncle Ebenezer, and thus gains knowledge that he has come into his full, substantial inheritance. David and Catriona, fast friends at this point, begin a series of misunderstandings that eventually drive her and James More away, though David sends payment to James in return for news of Catriona's welfare. James and Catriona find their way to Dunkirk in northern France. Meanwhile, Alan Breck joins David in Leyden, and he berates David for not understanding women.\nIt's this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them. Either they like the man, and then a' goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your breath \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ye can do naething. There's just the two sets of them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 them that would sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye're on. That's a' that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.\nProdded thus, and at an invitation from James More, David and Alan journey to Dunkirk to visit with James and Catriona. They all meet one evening at a remote inn and discover the following day that James has betrayed Alan (falsely convicted of the Appin murder) into the hands of a British warship anchored near the shore. The British attempt to capture Alan, who flees with David and Catriona, now reconciled and shamed by James More's ignominy. The three flee to Paris, where David and Catriona are married. James More dies from an illness, and David and Catriona return to Scotland to raise a family.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Being involved with the Appin murder"}], "question":

Ross Murdock is given the choice of facing a new medical procedure called Rehabilitation or volunteering to join a secret government project. Hoping for a chance to escape, Ross volunteers to join Operation Retrograde and is taken by Major John Kelgarries to a base built under the ice near the North Pole. Teamed with archaeologist Gordon Ashe, he is trained to mimic a trader of the Beaker culture of Bronze-Age Europe.\nSent back to southern Britain around 2000 B.C.E., Ross and Ashe (as Rossa and Assha) find that their outpost has been bombed, destroyed by the wrath of Lurgha, the local storm god, according to two of the natives. Discovering the direction whence the bomber came and other clues pointing to the general area occupied by the Soviet base, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil, the lone survivor of the bombing, go to that area.\nSomewhere near the Baltic Sea, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil begin building a Beaker trading post and learn from the locals that to their southeast lies a land populated by ghosts, a land whither no man of good sense would go. Ross gets separated from Ashe and McNeil in a night attack and must go into the taboo area alone in an effort to find them. Far inside the ghostland he finds the Soviet base and is captured by the Reds.\nIn an effort to escape Ross steps onto the base\u2019s transporter plate and is transferred to a Soviet base even further back in time. The Reds recapture him and take him outside the base, abandoning him on a glacier to freeze to death. He climbs out of the crevice into which he was shoved and follows the trail leading away from the Soviet base, coming to a giant globe half buried in the ice. Half dead from the abuse he has received, he enters the globe and then falls through a panel and into a tub full of transparent-red gel.\nWhen he regains consciousness Ross discovers that all of his wounds are healed, he is no longer hungry or thirsty, and his Beakerman clothing is gone. A mechanism offers him a skin-tight suit made of an iridescent dark-blue fabric that covers all but his head and his hands. He explores what is clearly some kind of ship and is recaptured by the Reds, but not before he activates the ship\u2019s communication system and comes face to face with a hostile-looking humanoid with a large bald head.\nThe Reds\u2019 interrogation of Ross is interrupted by explosions that rock the base. Ross is reunited with Ashe and McNeil and the three men escape to the time transporter, pausing only to steal some recording tapes. Back in the Soviet Bronze-Age base, the men leave the time-travel building and escape from the village just as the alien Baldies attack. The men then make their way to the river that will take them to the Baltic Sea to be picked up by their submarine.\nRoss is again separated from Ashe and McNeil when he falls off their hastily built and uncontrollable raft. He discovers that the Baldies are hunting him when he is captured by warriors from a barbarian tribe. Again he escapes and continues down the river, reaching the sea and the camp occupied by Ashe and/or McNeil only hours after the sub took them away. Two of the Baldies attempt to capture him with telepathic hypnosis, but they flee when Kelgarries and his men arrive. Leaving the alien skinsuit on the beach, so that the Baldies can\u2019t trace the Americans to their base, the men take Ross to the sub and home. There Ashe tells him that the tapes he stole indicate other alien spaceships abandoned on Earth, at least three of them in the Americas. Operation Retrograde is about to become much more interesting and Ross still wants to be part of the action.\nThe 2000 version: Norton modified the 1958 version by making three changes in the text;\n1. She reset the story in the first quarter of the Twenty-First Century instead of in the last quarter of the Twentieth, shifting the action futureward by a full generation.\n2. The Reds have become the Russians and Greater Russia has replaced the Soviet Union.\n3. Space travel has not gone beyond the first lunar landings instead of having not gotten beyond the first attempts to put satellites into orbit.

John McClane is waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for his wife Holly to arrive from Los Angeles. Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi Tower, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. In the airport bar McClane spots two men in army fatigues carrying a package, one of whom has a gun. He follows them into the baggage area. After a shootout, he kills one of the men while the other escapes. Learning the dead man is a mercenary thought killed in action while originally serving with the US military, McClane relates the situation to airport police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo has McClane ejected from his office.\nFormer U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart and other members of his unit set up a base in a church near Dulles. They take over the air traffic control systems, cut off communication to the planes and seize control of the airport. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and dictator of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. They demand a Boeing 747 cargo plane so they can escape to another country, and warn the airport controllers not to try to restore control. McClane realizes his wife is on one of the planes circling above Washington, D.C. with too little fuel to be redirected. He prepares to fight the terrorists, allying himself with a janitor, Marvin, to gain larger access to the airport.\nDulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to the unfinished Annex Skywalk with a SWAT team to re-establish communications with the planes. Stuart's henchmen ambush the group at a checkpoint, killing the SWAT team. With Marvin's help, McClane reaches the massacre scene, rescuing Barnes and killing Stuart's men. Stuart responds by recalibrating the instrument landing system and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a British jet, killing all 230 passengers and crew on board. A U.S. Army Special Forces team is called in, led by Major Grant. A two-way radio dropped by one of Stuart's henchmen tips McClane that Esperanza, who's killed his captors and is now flying, is landing.\nWith Marvin's aid, McClane reaches the aircraft before Stuart's henchmen, but Stuart traps him and throws grenades into the cockpit. McClane escapes via the ejection seat as the aircraft explodes. Barnes helps McClane locate the mercenaries's hideout and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location, but the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles. McClane pursues them, but the gun he picked up does not kill anyone when fired. He discovers that the gun is loaded with blanks, and concludes that the mercenaries and Special Forces have been working together all along.\nMcClane contacts Lorenzo to intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries will escape, proving his story by firing at Lorenzo with the blank gun. A suspicious Thornburg is monitoring airport radio traffic, and learns about the situation from a secret transmission to the circling planes from Barnes. He phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening, leading to panic and preventing the officers from reaching the escape plane. Holly subdues Thornburg with a taser.\nMcClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the wing of the mercenary plane. He blocks the ailerons with his jacket, preventing the plane from taking off. Grant emerges and fights McClane, but is sucked into the jet engine and killed.

Graham is approached at his Florida home by his former FBI superior Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina), who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife (Kim Greist) that he will do nothing more than examine evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, now dubbed the \"Tooth Fairy\" by the police for the bite-marks left on his victims.\nHaving found the killer's fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford. They are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds (Stephen Lang), with whom Graham has a bitter history; Lounds' paper had run photographs of Graham taken secretly while he was hospitalized. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer's motivations. After a tense conversation, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. A little later, Lecktor contrives and manages to obtain Graham's home address by deceit during his phone privileges.\nGraham travels to the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is contacted by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton (Benjamin Hendrickson), Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize it is from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor\u2014and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.\nThe FBI intends to plant a fake advertisement to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.\nGraham is told by Crawford that they have cracked Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy\u2014it is Graham's home address with an instruction to kill the family (ending with \"Save yourself. Kill them all,\" revealing that Lecktor believes Graham would find the Tooth Fairy). Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham's family to a safe house, he tries to explain to his son Kevin why he had retired previously.\nAt his job in a St. Louis film lab, Francis Dollarhyde\u2014The Tooth Fairy\u2014approaches a blind co-worker, Reba McClane (Joan Allen), and ends up offering her a lift. They go to Dollarhyde's home, where Reba is oblivious to the fact that Dollarhyde is watching home-movie footage of his planned next victim. She kisses him and they make love. Dollarhyde is confused by this newfound relationship, though it helps suppress his bloodlust. Just as Graham comes to realize how much the Tooth Fairy's desire for acceptance factors into the murders, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker. Mistakenly believing them to be kissing, Dollarhyde murders the man and abducts Reba. When she calls him Francis, he tells her: \"Francis is gone. Forever.\"\nDesperately trying to figure out a connection between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He left bite marks on his victims."}],

overtime to avoid being evicted, is approached at work by Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack (Jay Mohr), asking if she can supply 20 hits of ecstasy, which they were hoping to buy from her co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew). Realizing she can profit from the deal, she approaches Simon's dealer Todd Gaines (Timothy Olyphant) for the drugs, but as she is unable to pay, leaves her friend and co-worker Claire (Katie Holmes) with Todd while she makes her deal.\nOn trying to make the deal, Ronna grows suspicious of Burke (William Fichtner), a stranger with Adam and Zack, who presses her for the drugs. In a panic she flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves. Ronna then steals aspirin to replace the ecstasy she disposed of, helped by her friend and co-worker Mannie (Nathan Bexton), who had swallowed two of the pills without knowing their strength.\nRonna returns the pills to Todd and she, Claire and Mannie make their way to a rave. Todd soon discovers the pills are fake and pursues Ronna, discovering her at the rave. Ronna flees with Mannie but he is overcome by the drugs. Ronna leaves him in an alley and promises to return with her car, but Todd confronts her with a gun in the parking lot. Before he can shoot Ronna, she is hit by a car which speeds away.\nThe story restarts from the perspective of Simon, who is going to Las Vegas with his three friends Marcus (Taye Diggs), Tiny (Breckin Meyer), and Singh (James Duval). Singh and Tiny get food poisoning, leaving Simon and Marcus to their own devices. Simon crashes a wedding and has sex with two of the bridesmaids before their hotel room accidentally catches fire. Marcus and Simon leave the hotel, stealing a car from someone who thinks Marcus is a parking attendant.\nThe pair go to a strip club where Simon orders a lap dance using Todd's credit card for security, but enrages the bouncer Victor Jr. by groping one of the strippers. Simon shoots Victor Jr. with a gun he found in the stolen car, and he and Marcus flee to the hotel, rousing Tiny and Singh. The four barely escape the bouncer and his father, Victor Sr. (J. E. Freeman), but Victor Sr. traces Todd's address from the credit card Simon left at the strip club.\nThe story then changes perspective to Adam and Zack, actors in a daytime soap opera, who are secretly gay and in a relationship. Having been caught in a drug deal they are forced to work with Burke, a police detective, to entrap their dealer. Adam is fitted with a wire. When they cannot find their usual dealer Simon at the store where he works, the two convince Ronna to come up with the drugs. When Ronna arrives later to make the deal, Zack secretly warns her away and she disposes of the drugs in the bathroom.\nAfter the unsuccessful bust, Burke invites Adam and Zack to Christmas dinner. Adam and Zack observe strange behavior from Burke and his wife Irene (Jane Krakowski), Burke espousing the quality of his bed to Zack while naked, and Irene coming onto Adam. Burke finally pitches an Amway-type company to Adam and Zack over dinner, but the pair make excuses and leave.\nIdly discussing their infidelity to each other, Adam and Zack realize they both had cheated with the same person, Jimmy. They discover he is at a rave and confront him there, cutting his long hair. While leaving the rave they accidentally run over Ronna in the parking lot, panicking and driving away when they see Todd's gun.\nZack tries to reassure Adam that even if Ronna had survived being run over, Todd would have shot her. Adam then discovers to his horror that he is still wearing his wire. Fearing they have been recorded and will be discovered, the two return to the accident scene to remove Ronna's body, but discover she is still alive. They prop her up on a car, setting off its alarm, and watch from a distance as other party-goers call for an ambulance.\nClaire goes to a restaurant where she hoped to meet up with Mannie and Ronna, and sees Todd instead. Claire starts talking to Todd and the two soon go back to Todd's apartment building. While making out on the stairs, they are confronted by Victor Jr. and Sr. Todd offers Simon's address just as Simon arrives, having hoped to hide for a few days. There is a scuffle but it is stopped by Claire, who refuses to witness a murder. As a form of 'justice', Simon agrees to be shot in the arm by Victor Jr. Claire leaves in disgust, and hears a gunshot.\nRonna wakes up, to her confusion, in a hospital, and hobbles back to the supermarket, where Claire is also working.

Her mother committed suicide and the school counselor feels that she has not dealt with her feelings properly. Manning and her friends decide to visit the local video arcade known as \"Dante's Inferno\" where a new virtual reality arcade game called \"Arcade\" is being test marketed by a computer company CEO who is more than willing to hand out free samples of the home console version and hype up the game as if his job is depending on it, and it is.\nHowever, it soon becomes clear that the teenagers who play the game and lose are being imprisoned inside the virtual reality world by the central villain: \"Arcade\". It would seem that \"Arcade\" was once a little boy who was beaten to death by his mother, and the computer company felt it would be a good idea to use some of the boy's brain cells in order to make the game's villain more realistic. Instead, it made the game deadly. The game's programmer knew there would be a problem with this, and even tried, but failed, to convince the computer company, Vertigo/Tronics, to halt the game's release because of the company's unorthodox decision to use human brain cells in the game's development.\nNick and Alex enlist the help of the game's programmer and head to the video arcade for a final showdown with \"Arcade\" and his deadly virtual world. While Alex is able to release her friends from a virtual prison, she also ended up freeing the evil little boy, who taunts Alex in the final moments of the film.\nIn the original CGI version, however, the film ends on a somewhat happier note, with Alex, her friends, and Albert (the programmer) simply walking away from Dante's Inferno, with the donor's soul seemingly laid to rest.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She committed suicide."}], "question": "How did Alex's mom die?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\"Arcade.\""}], "question": "What game did Alex and her friends play?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "School counselors."}], "question": "Who feels Alex has not dealt with her feelings properly?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Human brain cells."}], "question": "What did Vertigo/Tronics install in the game's development?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The evil young boy, \"Arcade.\""}], "question": "Who does Alex release from the game besides her friends?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are imprisoned inside a virtual world."}], "question": "What happens when people lose in the game of Arcade?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To make the villain character of the game more realistic."}], "question": "Why did Vertigo/Tronics include the boy's brain cells into the game?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A young boy who was beaten to death."}], "question": "Whom did the brain cells installed in the game belong to?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The game's programmer."}], "question": "Who knew there would be a problem with installing human brain cells into the game?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His mother."}], "question": "Who beat the young boy \"Arcade\" to death?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She committed suicide."}], "question": "What happened to Alex Manning's mother?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It is named Dante's Inferno."}], "question": "What is the name of the local arcade where Alex and her friends like to go?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "There is a new virtual reality game called \"Arcade\"."}], "question": "What is so special that Alex and her friends want to go see at the arcade that day?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The losers get imprisoned inside the virtual reality game."}], "question": "What happens to the teenagers who lose at \"Arcade\"?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His mother beat him to death."}], "question": "What happened to the real little boy who was named Arcade?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The computer company felt that it would make the villain more realistic."}], "question": "Why would the computer company use some of the dead boy's brain cells in the game?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The game's programmer tried to stop the release of the game because he knew it was dangerous."}], "question": "What did the game's programmer do when he found out about the use of the dead boy's brain cells?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The game's programmer, Alex, and Nick."}], "question": "Who participate in the final showdown with \"Arcade\"?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Alex wants to release all her friends who were trapped in the game prison."}], "question": "Who does Alex hope to release from the game in the final showdown?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "\"Arcade\" himself, the evil dead boy is also released from the virtual game."}], "question": "In addition to her friends, who else is released from the game?", "id": "9d9741c1e26478633f439ec30de0329a5f4c02a7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The local video Arcade.

The unconventional hero has a literally bumpy start to his journey as he accidentally runs into a little old lady. Though she appears to be alright, Barret's fear of being arrested causes him to flee. However, because he is the hero, he cannot shake the guilty conscience and returns to the site of the accident, only to find that the old lady and the crowd that gathered to be gone. Wrought with worry, Barret makes his way to Mabberly. Mabberly has engaged a yacht and crew and intends to \"sail, without fail\" the next morning with Barrett and another schoolmate, Giles Jackman. The next day, not long at sea, misfortune befalls the party and they collide with a passing steamer, causing their vessel to split down the middle. Now in the water, the men make their way toward the rocky shore of a now-visible island. Upon arrival, the men elect Barrett to search for habitation. He comes across a sheep track, a primitive road and eventually a hut among the rocks. From here, Barrett begins to meet the people who reside on the island, all of whom are white. When the rest of the party joins Barrett, they are happy to learn the houses there are fully functioning (with kitchens and bedrooms, each stocked appropriately). As fate would have it, Barrett happens upon a young girl, Milly, lying on the road, who has injured her arm after falling from a cliff. Barret eventually develops feelings for her. He and Milly share a love for botany, which was the cause of her fall from the cliff, and use this area of interest to pave the way for further interaction. Elsewhere, the men engage in hunting outings as well as occasionally fishing (or in Archie's case, photography). Meanwhile, Milly has been writing home, telling her mother about the man who saved her life, effectively causing her mother to become fond of him. When news of Mrs. Moss' arrival reaches Barrett, he rushes to meet her, only to nearly knock her over. She turns out to be the very same woman Barrett had hit with his bicycle earlier on. At this point, though she recognizes him as the man who ran her down, she does not know he is Barret. After falling from a cliff and falling unconscious, Barrett does not show up for supper, worrying the others and causing them to search for him. Once found, he is unrecognizable due to the bruising and head-dressings he now bears, successfully continuing to hide his identity from Mrs. Moss. Once he has healed and she discovers that he is indeed Barrett, she agrees to forgive him, thus allowing Milly and him to marry.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is afraid he

Their relationship is shown in a photo montage; the montage ends with Celeste walking away from Jesse during a party.\nCeleste and Jesse still get along well. Celeste is a successful trend analyzer and runs her own media company with her partner, Scott (Elijah Wood). Celeste's media company has just signed Riley Banks (Emma Roberts), a teen pop-star whom Celeste does not respect and had openly bashed during a previous television interview. Jesse is an unemployed artist in no hurry to find a job.\nCeleste decides to separate but promises to stay friends and date other people. Jesse passively agrees, still in love with her and hoping for her to come back around. Celeste and Jesse's continuing closeness after their separation and in the process of divorcing becomes increasingly annoying to their mutual engaged best friends, Beth (Ari Graynor) and Tucker (Eric Christian Olsen). Beth tries to reason with the divorcing couple of the weirdness, but Celeste rationalizes that it is better for her and Jesse to maintain their friendship. Even their other mutual friend Skillz (Will McCormack) agrees that it is time for the two to move on with their lives.\nCeleste is at first content with her current situation until they spend a night together. Realizing that a reconciliation is not possible, Jesse finally decides to move out while ignoring Celeste's apologies. One day Jesse announces that his new girlfriend Veronica is pregnant, which does not sit well with Celeste. She expresses her concern to Beth who questions her about having second thoughts with the divorce. To distract herself, Celeste takes up exercising and dates other people.\nDuring her date with Max (Rich Sommer), Celeste runs into Jesse. The encounter becomes awkward for Celeste, but not for Max who finds Jesse to be a cool guy. Having gone through his own divorce, Max then confronts her that she's not ready to be dating again and to take her time. After a few more awkward dates with other men, Celeste meets Paul (Chris Messina) in yoga class and dresses him down for trying to hit on her but eventually warms up to him after meeting him again at a party. In the meantime, Jesse takes on more responsibility for Veronica and their child and matures along the way. Celeste realizes that her decision to divorce Jesse was impulsive and selfish, and wants to reunite with him. They then fight about her controlling nature and his slacker ways and go their separate ways on bad terms.\nCeleste later gets a call from Riley asking her to come over. Celeste believes that Riley is angry over the logo she designed for her that unintentionally resembles a penis going into a butt. The logo sparks controversy with her tween fanbase. She arrives at Riley's house to find her in tears. Riley reveals that she has had a secret boyfriend, who she discovered has been cheating on her. They form an unexpected bond over their shared heartbreak and slowly become friends. At a nightclub with Riley, Celeste realizes the logo appeals to Riley's gay fan base, and they could use this to make her the next Lady Gaga. While walking with Riley, Celeste runs into Rupert (Rafi Gavron) a young, hot model she had rejected after an awkward date, and introduces him to Riley.\nAt Beth and Tucker's wedding, Celeste makes a toast. She tells the newlyweds to appreciate each other, to be patient, and to try harder, like she should have. This speech touches Jesse, and he thanks Celeste. They are able to reconcile and become friends again.\nOn a karaoke date, Celeste informs Paul of her need to take some time to recover from the divorce, which he says he understands. We then see Celeste and Jesse finally signing their divorce papers and laughing at each other's inside jokes. Their lawyers look on, confused by their laughter. Celeste wishes Jesse well. She finally asks Jesse if he loves Veronica, to which he responds that he does. Celeste encourages him to keep fighting for it and they have one last kiss. Celeste begins to finally move on with her life and with Paul.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Celeste walks away from Jesse during a party"}], "question": "What happens at the end

works for a left-wing radical magazine. Following an incident at a party where Sidney accidentally lets a pig loose, he is hired to work for an affluent magazine in New York City. He is hired by Clayton Harding (Jeff Bridges), editor of Sharps magazine, a man Sidney had previously satirised in his own magazine.\nSidney frustrates the staff he works with, first Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), who is only there to pay the bills whilst she finishes her book, then his boss Lawrence Maddox (Danny Huston). He also dares to target the star clients of power publicist Eleanor Johnson (Gillian Anderson). He then meets new rising star Sophie Maes (Megan Fox); however, he is told by Lawrence not to talk to her. Sidney makes it his mission to become a somebody within the business; however, it is almost ruined when he accidentally kills Sophie's dog Cuba; trying to play with the dog, Sidney threw a ball that accidentally went out his office window and as he stopped the dog from going out the window he unfortunately proceeded to cause a vase to fall onto the dog. Luckily, Alison covers for him and nobody else finds out it was him.\nAt a party, Alison and Sidney's relationship strengthens when she reveals she has just ended an affair with Lawrence. Sidney stops her from driving home drunk, causing him to miss his opportunity to sleep with Sophie. At a later party, however, just when Sidney was about to ask her out, it is revealed Lawrence has left his wife and that he and Alison are officially together. In an eager attempt to boost his career, he begs Eleanor to publish a piece on Vincent (Max Minghella), a director he intensely dislikes.\nThe next day at work Clayton reveals that both Alison and Lawrence have left, and he promotes Sidney. Sidney finally becomes successful, attracting all the girls that were previously repulsed by him and even catching the eye of Sophie. The night before the awards ceremony she stated that if he gave her his late mother's ring and she won best actress, she would have sex with him. Going to the ceremony the next day he sees Lawrence, now being someone he used to be, stating that he and Alison split up as she was in love with Sidney. When Sophie is announced as the winner, as she is going to collect her award, he realizes he does not truly love her and asks for his ring back, then, after a heated argument, he steals back the ring from Sophie, and inadvertently (because of anger) reveals that he killed Cuba. A furious Sophie assaults him and a huge fight ensues. After the fight, Sidney leaves, quitting his job at Sharps and heads back to New York.\nHe meets Alison in the park, where they were showing her favourite movie, La Dolce Vita. She has finished her book and the two finally get together, with him giving her his mother's ring. The movie ends with him accidentally throwing the book onto a candle and jumping for it to stop it from burning into flames.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Clayton Harding"}], "question": "Who hired Sydney to work for him in New York?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To pay bill while she finished her book."}], "question": "Why was Alison Olsen working?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lawrence"}], "question": "Who warned Sydney to not talk to Sophie?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Accidentally killing Sophie's dog."}], "question": "How did Sydney almost ruin his popularity?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Alison"}], "question": "Who covers for Sydney in regards to how Cuba died?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "At a party."}], "question": "Where did Alison tell Sydney about her and Lawrence's affair?", "id": "9f312d4d32915822056abb59f26f070881806430"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Both Alison and Lawrence left"}], "question": "Why did Sidney get promoted?

To the world around him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard.\nStevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \"on mission\" to find the bomber before a large \"dirty bomb\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \"Source Code\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.\nStevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \"with them\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees.\nStevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In one run-through, Frost kills both Fentress and Christina, and flees in a rented white van. Stevens remembers the license number and direction and the authorities use this information to catch the terrorist, preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb. The mission finished, Rutledge reneges on his promise, ordering Goodwin to wipe Stevens' memory for a future mission. Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow one more try, to save everyone on the train, despite Rutledge's insistence that everyone on the train had already been killed in the explosion.\nStevens is sent back into the Source Code where he disarms the bomb, subdues Frost and handcuffs him to a handrail inside the train. He reports the bomber to authorities, sends an email to Captain Goodwin, then calls to reconcile with his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier. He asks Christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live, and starts to kiss her. At the same time, Goodwin approaches the air-tight chamber that contains the torso of Stevens' comatose mutilated body, disconnects the life support, and Stevens dies. Rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain. The scene cuts to Stevens finishing the kiss with Christina inside the Source Code, revealing that the alternate timeline of the Source Code has become real, contrary to what was proposed by Rutledge. They continue on the train, and then walk through downtown Chicago to the Cloud Gate, a sculpture whose image Stevens saw during transitions out of the Source Code. This prompts Stevens to ask Christina \"Do you believe in fate?\" As they stand in front of the mirrored sculpture, Stevens' reflection in the Cloud Gate is seen to be the image of Sean Fentress.\nWhen the alternative-timeline Goodwin arrives for work at Nellis Air Force Base that morning, she receives the email from Stevens. While news breaks about the failed bomber on the Chicago train, the email informs Goodwin that they have changed history, and Goodwin seemingly recalls something. The email asks her to reassure this timeline's Stevens that \"everything is gonna be okay\". The scene cuts to Stevens who, in this timeline, is still comatose, hooked up to the neural sensors in the airtight chamber.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It explodes."}],

his team aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc\u00e9 Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\nAware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\nCal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, he has his bodyguard slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\nAfter braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.\nWith Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. She later finds out Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the 1929 Wall Street crash.\nBack in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean \u2014 in her possession all along \u2014 and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed, photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack.

Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans to the Galactic Empire's Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of destroying planets. Rebel leader Princess Leia has the plans, but her ship is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil Sith lord Darth Vader. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory of an astromech droid, R2-D2, along with a holographic recording. The droid flees to the surface of the desert planet Tatooine with C-3PO, a protocol droid.\nThe droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning R2-D2, Luke accidentally triggers part of Leia's message, in which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 searching for Obi-Wan, and meets Ben Kenobi, an old hermit who lives in the hills and reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as a Jedi Knight, former Galactic Republic peacekeepers with supernatural powers derived from an energy called The Force, who were all but wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncle's statements, Luke learns that his father, Anakin, fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan tells Luke that Vader was his former pupil who turned to the dark side of the Force and killed Anakin. Obi-Wan presents Luke his father's weapon - a lightsaber.\nObi-Wan views Leia's complete message, in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Obi-Wan invites Luke to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force. Luke declines, but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers searching for C-3PO and R2-D2 have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle. Obi-Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca to transport them to Alderaan on Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon.\nUpon the Falcon's arrival at the location of Alderaan, the group discover that the planet has been destroyed by order of the Death Star's commanding officer, Grand Moff Tarkin, as a show of power. The Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. While Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned aboard, and with the help of Han and Chewbacca, rescues her. After several escapes, the group makes its way back to the Falcon. Obi-Wan disables the tractor beam, and on the way back to the Falcon, he engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. Once he is sure the others can escape, Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed. The Falcon escapes the Death Star, unknowingly carrying a tracking beacon, which the Empire follows to the Rebels' hidden base on Yavin IV.\nThe Rebels analyze the Death Star's plans and identify a vulnerable exhaust port that connects to the station's main reactor. Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron, while Han collects his payment for the transport and intends to leave, despite Luke's request that he stay and help. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses after several unsuccessful attack runs, leaving Luke as one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base.

The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Instead, owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel, The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital is not well received, even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, with 14 children to support.\nEven less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's newly appointed chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold, and hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the orders of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Dr Stanhope has been there, recovering from a sore throat, for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and his three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope: Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a crippled serial flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled by her and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, her servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame and cannot keep away. Dr Stanhope's son Bertie is skilled at spending money but not at making it: his two sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will provide financial security for him.\nSummoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the brilliant Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A massive misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin: they all believe she intends to marry the oily chaplain Mr Slope. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope also interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party of the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of their misunderstanding Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged. The old Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become Dean, but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and fifteen acres of garden. However, Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and, with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean.\nWith the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to its previous quiet and settled ways and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The deceased bishop's son Archdeacon Grantly."}], "question": "Who was expected to take over as bishop after the previous one died?", "id": "a1ddafa4cb19dd13dd41e6c10d81839dcce36ec7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She gives it to Mr. Quiverful.

Realising that he has offended her, the Colonel gives Laura a more honourable proposal of marriage, but she refuses him gently on grounds of moral incompatibility, despite this meaning that she would miss out on the Colonel's title and fortune. Captain Montreville, Laura's father, finds out that Laura's annuity is not assured, and so takes Laura to London to fix the matter. Without the knowledge of her father, Laura consents to marry the Colonel eventually, if he can reform himself within two years.\nWhen she is left without any money in London, she decides to support her ailing father by selling sketches. During her time in London, a man named Montague De Courcy begins to fall in love with her. De Courcy buys Laura's sketches in secret. Hargrave follows Laura to London, and he becomes involved in an affair with a married woman. Hargrave meets Laura in the shop where she sells her sketches and paintings, and accompanies her home and harasses her. Hargrave's affair is found out by his lover's husband, and the two men duel. Hargrave wounds the husband, and then goes to Laura, urging her to marry him before she finds out about his affair. Because Hargrave threatens to kill himself, Laura faints, and is found by her father, who then realises that Hargrave has been threatening his daughter, and he has been encouraging Hargrave. This causes Captain Montreville such grief that he dies the next morning. When Captain Montreville dies of his illness, Laura goes to live with Lady Pelham, her maternal aunt. Lady Pelham helps Laura receive her annuity, but she is not religious and colludes with Colonel Hargrave. Laura learns of Hargrave's duel, and resolves to refuse him. Hargrave attempts to persuade her to marry him by more drastic measures - having her arrested under false pretenses, tricking her into joining a gambling party, and when Lady Pelham dies, Hargrave kidnaps Laura and takes her to the wilderness of America. He plans to rape and then force Laura into marriage - she fakes her own death by escaping down the rapids in a canoe, which she ties herself to. Hargrave commits suicide, and Laura returns to her home country, where she marries Montague De Courcy and has five children with him.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Colonel"}], "question": "Whate is Hargrave's military rank?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Colonel Hargrave"}], "question": "Who pursues Laura Montreville?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "On the grounds of moral incompatibility"}], "question": "Why does Laura refuse Hargrave's marriage proposal?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hargrave's title and fortune"}], "question": "By reefusing the marriage proposal, what does Laura miss out on?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "London"}], "question": "Where does Laura's father take her?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "sell sketches"}], "question": "What does Laura do in order to support her ailing father?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "follows her home and harrasses her"}], "question": "What does Hargrave do after meeting Laura in London?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "duel"}], "question": "After Hargrave's affairs husband finds out  about their affair, what do the 2 men do?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hargrave threatens to kill himself"}], "question": "Why does Laura faint?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "injures him"}], "question": "What does Hargrave do to the husband in the duel?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Reform himself in two years"}], "question": "What did Laura Monreville tell Colonel Hargrave he must do in order for her to marry him?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sketches"}], "question": "What does Laura sell to financially support her ailing father?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Montague De Courcy"}], "question": "What was the name of the man that began to fall in love with Laura during her time in London?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An affair with a married woman"}], "question": "What did Hargrave become involved in when he followed Laura to London?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marry him"}], "question": "What was Hargrave urging Laura to do before she found out about the affair he was having?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Pelham"}], "question": "Who did Laura go live with after Captain Montreville dies from his illness?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Had her arrested under false pretenses and tricked her into joining a gambling party"}], "question": "What were two of the more drastic measures Hargrave took to attempt to persuade Laura to marry him?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A wilderness in America"}], "question": "Where does Hargrave take Laura after kidnapping her?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rape Laura and force her into marriage"}], "question": "What two things did Hargrave plan to do after kidnapping Laura?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By tying herself to the bottom of a canoe and escaping down the river"}], "question": "How does Laura fake her own death?", "id": "a2cb171c562fce09b6f2473dc65f121cce677b7f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sketches.

The Woggle-Bug, who favors flashy clothes with bright colors (he dresses in \"gorgeous reds and yellows and blues and greens\" and carries a pink handkerchief), falls in love with a gaudy \"Wagnerian plaid\" dress that he sees on a mannequin in a department store window. Being a woggle bug, he has trouble differentiating between the dress and its wearers, wax or human. The dress is on sale for $7.93 (\"GREATLY REDUCED\" reads the tag). The Bug works for two days as a ditchdigger (he earns double pay since he digs with four hands) for money to buy the dress.\nHe arrives too late, though; the dress has been sold, and makes its way through the second-hand market. The Bug pursues his love through the town, ineptly courting the women (Irish, Swedish, and African-American, plus one Chinese man) who have the dress in turn. His pursuit eventually leads to an accidental balloon flight to Africa. There, menacing Arabs want to kill the Woggle-Bug, but he convinces them that his death would bring bad luck. In the jungle he falls in with the talking animals that are the hallmark of Baum's imaginative world.\nIn the end, the Bug makes his way back to the city, with a necktie made from the dress's loud fabric.

Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a beauty spot on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the nitrate film quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a musical together.\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure!\" revealing his French accent. The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Valentin"}], "question": "What famous man does Peppy happen to bump into?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Variety"}], "question": "What newspaper publishes a photo of Peppy's meeting with Valentin?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Who's that girl?"}], "question": "What headline does Variety run the Peppy story with?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The stock market crash"}], "question": "What historical financial event takes place in 1929?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Talking pictures"}], "question": "What new genre of motion picture does Peppy become a star of?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Silent pictures"}], "question": "What old genre of motion picture was Valentin a star of?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peppy"}], "question": "Who buys Valentin's possessions in an auction?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peppy's dancing picture"}], "question": "Which picture is Valentin found holding in a burning apartment?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Quit acting"}], "question": "What does Peppy threaten to do if Zimmer does not include Valentin in a new picture?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dancing"}], "question": "What talent does Valentin discover works in talking pictures?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She accidentally bumps into him on a movie set."}], "question": "How does Peppy Miller meet George Valentin?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A beauty mark."}], "question": "What is Peppy's trademark?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Most of his normal audience goes to see Peppy's new movie instead."}], "question": "Why is Valentin's new picture unsuccessful?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He goes bankrupt and his wife kicks him out."}], "question": "What happens as a result of Valentin's picture failing?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His dog."}], "question": "Who saves Valentin from the apartment fire?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The film  where he danced with Peppy."}], "question": "What was the only picture saved from the fire?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peppy."}], "question": "Who bought Valentin's items that were up for auction?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Valentin was trying to kill himself."}], "question": "What does Peppy catch Valentin doing in his apartment after the fire?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A musical"}], "question": "What type of silent picture do Valentin and Peppy make together?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peppy Miller."}], "question": "Who accidentally bumps into George Valentin?", "id": "a44a175d05d139a1cb1c9ddc6879ffcd66b0e2c4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peppy auditions as a dancer.

In the opening narration, he explains how he had a troubled relationship with his father, John Kinsella, who had been a devoted baseball fan. While walking through his cornfield one evening, he hears a voice whispering, \"If you build it, he will come.\" He continues hearing it before finally seeing a vision of a baseball diamond in his field. Annie is skeptical of that, but she allows him to plow the corn under in order to build a baseball field. As he builds it, he tells Karin the story of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. As months pass and nothing happens at it, his family faces financial ruin until, one night, Karin spots a uniformed man in it. Ray recognizes him as Shoeless Joe Jackson, a deceased baseball player idolized by John. Thrilled to be able to play baseball again, he asks to bring others to the field to play. He later returns with the seven other players banned as a result of the 1919 scandal.\nRay's brother-in-law, Mark, can't see the players and warns him that he will go bankrupt unless he replants his corn. While in the field, Ray hears the voice again, this time urging him to \"ease his pain.\"\nRay attends a PTA meeting at which the possible banning of books by radical author Terence Mann is discussed. He decides the voice was referring to Mann. He comes across a magazine interview dealing with Mann's childhood dream of playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. After Ray and Annie both dream about him and Mann attending a baseball game together at Fenway Park, he convinces her that he should seek out Mann. He heads to Boston and persuades a reluctant, embittered Mann to attend a game with him at Fenway Park. While there, he hears the voice again; this time urging him to \"go the distance.\" At the same time, the scoreboard \"shows\" statistics for a player named Archibald \"Moonlight\" Graham, who played one game for the New York Giants in 1922, but never had a turn at bat. After the game, Mann eventually admits that he, too, saw it.\nRay and Mann then travel to Chisholm, Minnesota where they learn that Graham had become a doctor and had died sixteen years earlier. During a late night walk, Ray finds himself back in 1972 and encounters the then-living Graham, who states that he had moved on from his baseball career. He also says that the greater disappointment would have been not having a medical career. He declines Ray's invitation to fulfill his dream; however, during the drive back home, Ray picks up a young hitchhiker who introduces himself as Archie Graham. While Archie sleeps, Ray reveals to Mann that John had wanted him to live out his dream of being a baseball star. He stopped playing catch with him after reading one of Mann's books at 14. At 17, he had denounced Shoeless Joe as a criminal to John and that was the reason for the rift between them. Ray expresses regret that he didn't get a chance to make things right before John died. When they arrive back at Ray's farm, they find that enough players have arrived to field two teams. A game is played and Archie finally gets his turn at bat.\nThe next morning, Mark returns and demands that Ray sell the farm. Karin says that they will not need to because people will pay to watch the ballgames. Mann agrees, saying that \"people will come\" in order to relive their childhood innocence. Ray, after much thought, refuses and a frustrated Mark scuffles with him, during which Karin is accidentally knocked off the bleachers. The young Graham runs from the field to help, becoming old Graham, complete with Gladstone bag, the instant he steps off of it, and saves Karin from choking (she had been eating a hot dog when she fell). Ray realizes that Graham sacrificed his young self in order to save her. After reassuring Ray that his true calling was medicine and being commended by the other players, Graham leaves, disappearing into the corn. Suddenly, Mark is able to see the players and urges Ray not to sell the farm.\nAfter the game, Shoeless Joe invites Mann to enter the corn; he accepts and disappears into it. Ray is angry at not being invited, but Shoeless Joe rebukes him: if he really wants a reward for having sacrificed so much, then he had better stay on the field. Shoeless Joe then glances towards a player at home plate, saying \"If you build it, he will come.\" The player then removes his mask, and Ray recognizes him to be John as a young man. Shocked, Ray realizes that \"ease his pain\" referred to John, and believes that Shoeless Joe was the voice all along; however, Joe implies that the voice was Ray himself. Joe then disappears into the corn.\nRay introduces John to Annie and Karin. As he heads towards the corn, Ray asks him if he wants to play a game of catch. They begin to play and Annie happily watches. Meanwhile, hundreds of cars can be seen approaching the baseball field, fulfilling Karin and Mann's prophecy that people will come to watch baseball.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

descended from the Mayflower and composed of illustrious White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ancestors whose portraits line the walls. The religious theme is repeatedly mentioned, and Elaine is the daughter of the minister who lives next door, with some scenes held in its ancient cemetery. Today the Brewster clan comprises insane murderers.\nDespite having written several books ridiculing marriage as an \"old-fashioned superstition\", Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) falls in love with Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), who grew up next door to him in Brooklyn, and, on Halloween day, they marry. Immediately after the wedding, Mortimer visits the eccentric but lovable relatives who raised him and who still live in his old family home: his elderly aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair), and his brother Teddy (John Alexander), who believes he is Theodore Roosevelt. Each time Teddy goes upstairs, he yells \"Charge!\" and takes the stairs at a run, imitating Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill.\nMortimer finds a corpse hidden in a window seat and assumes that Teddy has committed murder under some delusion, but his aunts explain that they are responsible (\"It's one of our charities\"). They explain in the most innocent terms that they have developed what Mortimer calls the \"very bad habit\" of ending the presumed suffering of lonely old bachelors by serving them elderberry wine spiked with arsenic, strychnine and \"just a pinch of cyanide\". The bodies are buried in the basement by Teddy, who believes he is digging locks for the Panama Canal and burying yellow fever victims.\nTo complicate matters further, Mortimer's brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) arrives with his alcoholic accomplice, plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). Jonathan is a murderer trying to escape the police and find a place to dispose of the corpse of his latest victim, a certain Mr. Spenalzo. Jonathan's face, as altered by Einstein while drunk, looks like Boris Karloff's in his makeup as Frankenstein's monster. This resemblance  is frequently noted, much to Jonathan's annoyance. Jonathan, upon finding out his aunts' secret, decides to bury Spenalzo in the cellar (to which Abby and Martha object vehemently, because their victims were all nice gentlemen while Mr. Spenalzo is a stranger and a \"foreigner\") and soon declares his intention to kill Mortimer.\nWhile Elaine waits at her family home next door for Mortimer to take her on their honeymoon, Mortimer makes increasingly frantic attempts to stay on top of the situation, including multiple efforts to alert the bumbling local cops to the threat Jonathan poses, as well as to get the paperwork filed that will have Teddy declared legally insane and committed to a mental asylum (giving him a safe explanation for the bodies should the cops find them, and preventing his aunts from creating any more victims because they will no longer have any place to bury the bodies). He also worries that he will go insane like the rest of the Brewster family. As he puts it, \"Insanity runs in my family, practically gallops!\" While explaining this to Elaine, he claims they've been crazy since the first Brewsters came to America as pilgrims.\nBut eventually Jonathan is arrested, while Teddy is safely consigned to an asylum and the two aunts insist upon joining him. Finally, Abby and Martha inform Mortimer that he is not biologically related to the Brewsters after all: his real mother was the aunts' cook and his father had been a chef on a steamship. If he is not an upper-class Brewster then he realizes he will not become insane or a murderer. In the film's closing scene, after lustily kissing Elaine and before whisking her away to their honeymoon, he gleefully exclaims \"I'm not a Brewster, I'm a son of a sea cook!\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elaine Harper"}], "question": "Who does Mortimer Brewster fallin love with?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brooklyn, NY"}], "question": "Where did Mortimer and Elaine grow up?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He thinks his brother murdered the corpse."}], "question": "What does Mortimer think of the corpse in the window seat?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Teddy"}], "question": "What is the name of Mortimer's brother?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Teddy belives he is digging locks for the Panama canal and buyring the bodies of yellow fever victims."}], "question": "What does Teddy belives he is doing in the basement?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Plastic surgeon"}], "question": "What is Dr. Einstein's occupation?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They came over on the Mayflower"}], "question": "How did the Bewster's come to America?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Chef"}], "question": "What was the occupation of Mortimer's biological father?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Abby and Martha's cook"}], "question": "Who was Mortimer's biological mother?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Two"}], "question": "How many brother'sdoes Mortimer have?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Protestantism "}], "question": "What religious identification did the Brewster family's ancestors belong to?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "marriage"}], "question": "What traditional societal value does Mortimer Brewster deride in his novels?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Halloween Day"}], "question": "On what day does Elaine and Mortimer Brewster marry?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "because he has written several novels ridiculing marriage as \"old-fashioned superstition\""}], "question": "Why is it ironic that Mortimer falls in love and marry Elaine?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jonathan"}], "question": "What is the name of Mortimer's brother?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Plastic Surgery"}], "question": "What specific profession of doctoring does Dr. Herman Einstein practice?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cellar"}], "question": "Where does Jonathan bury Spenalzo?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That he is not an actual Brewster by blood."}], "question": "What truth does Mortimer's Aunt's reveal to him?", "id": "a599bc51361cc3e229dfdf5aadc4089fa913b6ee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She was a sea cook"}], "question": "What did Mortimer's real mother do for a living?

The house is built in the shape of the stern of a ship. Lady Utterword, Shotover's other daughter, arrives from Australia, but he pretends not to recognise her. Hesione says they are running out of money. Shotover needs to invent a weapon of mass destruction. His last invention, a lifeboat, did not bring in much cash. Ellie intends to marry businessman Boss Mangan, but she really loves a man she met in the National Gallery. Unfortunately, her fianc\u0102\u0160 is a ruthless scoundrel, her father's a bumbling prig, and it turns out that the man she's in love with is Hector, Hesione's husband, who spends his time telling romantic lies to women.

It turns out that the burglar is one of Shotover's old crewmen. He confesses that he is not a real burglar. He deliberately gets himself captured to get charitable assistance from his victims. Shotover laments that the younger generation have lost their romance. Ellie suggests that she should marry Shotover, but he says he's already married to a black Jamaican wife, though it's possible she's now dead.\nLady Utterword says that everything will be put to right if only they get some horses.

The lights are switched off, but Hector switches them back on to demonstrate his lack of concern about the threat.

dead Bussy. Unlike the ruthless Bussy, Clermont is a Christian Stoic. Clermont is a follower of the Duc de Guise, a powerful nobleman\u00e2\u0080\u0094though this relationship breeds suspicion in the King, who is urged on by the political manipulator Baligny. (Malicious characters in the play see Clermont's devotion to the Guise in homoerotic terms; but the stoical Clermont prefers relations with men over those with women, precisely because they are asexual.) Eventually the Guise is assassinated, and Clermont commits suicide. A subplot involves the relationship between Clermont and Tamyra, Bussy's former lover; Tamyra urges Clermont to take vengeance on her husband Montsurry, the agent of Bussy's destruction. The cowardly Montsurry manages to avoid a confrontation with Clermont through most of the play; but in the final Act, Bussy's ghost rises to tell Clermont that divine justice demands the punishment of Montsurry. Clermont finally persuades Montsurry to face him on the field of honor and accept his death.\nThe Stoic nature of the play extends beyond the values and worldview of the character Clermont. In The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, even more so than in other Chapman plays, events are reported rather than enacted, and little actually happens on stage.

Joseph Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son, and daughter Murphy, who believes her bedroom is haunted by a poltergeist. When a pattern is created out of dust on the floor, Cooper realizes that gravity is behind its formation, not a \"ghost\". He interprets the pattern as a set of geographic coordinates formed into binary code. Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA facility, where they are met by Cooper's former professor Dr. Brand (Caine).\nBrand reveals that a wormhole mysteriously appeared near Saturn 48 years earlier, opening a pathway to a distant galaxy with potentially habitable planets. Twelve volunteers traveled through it to assess each planet's suitability as humanity's new home, led by Dr. Mann (Damon). Volunteers Miller, Edmunds and Mann have sent back encouraging data from planets near a black hole called Gargantua. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spaceship Endurance to investigate further, while he works on \"Plan A\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a gravitational theory for propulsion that would allow a mass exodus from Earth. The Endurance also carries 5,000 frozen embryos for the \"Plan B\" backup plan, which is to colonize a habitable planet to ensure humanity's survival. Cooper agrees to go, upsetting Murphy.\nCooper's crew consists of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Brand's daughter Amelia (Hathaway), and robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they head to Miller's planet, an ocean world where time is severely dilated because of its proximity to Gargantua; for each hour there, seven years pass on Earth. They find only the wreckage from Miller's expedition. Amelia retrieves Miller's data just before a gigantic tidal wave hits, killing Doyle and water-logging the engines. After returning to Endurance, they discover 23 years have elapsed on Earth.\nMurphy (Chastain), now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits to her that Plan A was not feasible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he has known since Endurance departed. He reveals that Plan B was the only plan all along. In a recorded video session Murphy notifies Amelia of her father's death, accusing her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. Believing the equations can be solved, she continues working on a solution to Plan A knowing she needs more data on gravitational singularities.\nWith limited fuel, the crew choose Mann's planet over Edmunds' as the next stop, since Mann is still transmitting. Once there, Mann assures the crew that the frozen planet is habitable despite its ammonia-laden atmosphere. Then, while out together surveying the planet, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data in hopes of being rescued. He steals Cooper's ranger and heads for Endurance. Meanwhile, Romilly is killed by a booby trap set by Mann. Amelia rescues Cooper and they race to Endurance in a second lander, where Mann is attempting a dangerous manual docking operation. Mann ignores Cooper's warnings and is killed in the attempt, severely damaging the Endurance in the process. Cooper uses the lander to stabilize the ship.\nCASE warns Cooper that Endurance is slipping toward Gargantua's pull. Cooper makes a quick decision to use Gargantua as a gravitational slingshot to propel the ship toward Edmunds' planet, but their proximity to Gargantua means more time will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves toward the black hole, so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey. Slipping past the event horizon, Cooper and TARS find themselves inside a tesseract, which resembles a stream of bookshelves capable of peering into Murphy's bedroom at different periods in her life. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created to enable communication with Murphy, and that he was her \"ghost\" all along. Using the second-hand on the watch he gave her before he left, Cooper relays the quantum data Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation.\nFollowing a turbulent ejection, Cooper awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites with an aged Murphy nearing death. At Murphy's request, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia on Edmunds' habitable planet, where she is preparing a new human colony.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By interpreting the dust on the floor of his daughter's bedroom as geographic coordinates and traveling to the location where they are being planned."}], "question": "How does Cooper find out about the secret NASA missions?", "id": "a8771e0706c5b98b55c60b8dc3b9668295315712"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To use a gravitational propulsion system that would enable a mass exodus from Earth."}], "question": "What is the Plan A mission?", "id": "a8771e0706c5b98b55c60b8dc3b9668295315712"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A former professor of Cooper's, now working with NASA."}], "question": "Who is Dr. Brand?", "id": "a8771e0706c5b98b55c60b8dc3b9668295315712"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Edmunds'"}], "question": "Which astronaut landed on the planet that is likely habitable?", "id": "a8771e0706c5b98b55c60b8dc3b9668295315712"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Endurance."}], "question": "What is the name of the spaceship that Cooper, Romilly, Doyle, Amelia, and robots TARS and CASE use to travel through the wormhole?

Megamind is consistently defeated by Metroman and is in prison. After using a holographic watch to escape with the aid of Minion, a talking fish with the robotic body of a gorilla, he kidnaps Metro Man's supposed love interest, reporter Roxanne Ritchi and holds her hostage to lure him into a trap. Finding that copper is Metro Man's one weakness, Megamind's plan to obliterate him with a death ray powered by the sun succeeds, and Megamind finally takes over the city.\nHis joy is short lived though, as without a hero to fight, he finds his life has become meaningless. He goes to the Metroman Museum, which was dedicated to him on the day of his death and nearly runs into Roxanne. He uses his holographic watch to disguise himself as the museum's curator Bernard, and she innocently gives him the idea of creating a new superhero to take Metro Man's place.\nAfter creating a formula from Metroman's DNA, Roxanne intervenes in his plans and he accidentally injects the serum into Hal Stewart, Roxanne's dimwitted cameraman, who has an unrequited crush on her. Under the guise of his \"Space Dad\", Megamind tries to mold Hal into a superhero named Titan, as it was the only name he could trademark but this was mishearded by Hal as \"Tighten\". Unfortunately, Hal's ambitions are crushed when he sees Roxanne and Megamind as Bernard on a date. However, Megamind's disguise falters during dinner and she rejects him, causing him to lose track of his invisible car which contains the gun capable of removing Hal's powers.\nOn the day of their planned battle, Hal doesn't show up and Megamind finds that he has been using his powers for ill-gotten gains and wants to team up with Megamind to take over Metro City. Megamind tells Hal that he tricked him, revealing his Space Dad and Bernard disguises, which infuriates Hal, and tries to destroy Megamind. Megamind activates a failsafe to trap Hal in copper as it was Metro Man's weakness, but that too fails. After he escapes, Megamind pleads with Roxanne for help, and they go to Metro Man's hideout to search for clues to why the copper didn't work. Instead they find Metro Man, still alive but having felt pushed into life of a superhero, he chose to fake his death so he could retire in order to do something that he wanted to do, pursue a career in music. He refuses to help despite the danger, but encourages Megamind that good will always rise up against evil.\nNot seeing himself as a hero, Megamind gives up and returns to prison. Meanwhile, Hal kidnaps Roxanne and holds her hostage to call Megamind out of hiding. Megamind begs the Warden to release him to face this threat, inadvertently apologizing for an argument he'd had with Minion earlier that caused the two to separate. Minion reveals himself under the Warden's disguise and the two leave to face Hal together.\nAt Metro Tower, Hal threatens to send it toppling into the city with Roxanne tied to the roof. Megamind appears and tricks Hal, freeing Roxanne and the two flee as he throws the tower at them. Roxanne gets away, but Megamind is struck by the tower's antenna and appears near death. Metro Man finally appears and chases Hal away from the scene as Roxanne discovers that the Megamind that saved her was actually Minion, and that Metro Man is actually Megamind in disguise. He successfully intimidates Hal, but accidentally mispronounces the city's name Metro City as Matrocity, as Megamind often did and Hal returns. Finding the invisible car, Megamind grabs the diffuser gun just as Hal hurls him into the sky. To avoid falling to his death, Megamind dehydrates himself and lands in the fountain in front of Hal. He immediately rehydrates; his de-powering gun lands in his hands and he fires it at Hal, removing the villain's powers and returning him to normal. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival.\nIn a mid-credits scene Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine. After chiding Megamind about cleaning out his pockets, he knocks Bernard out with the Forget-Me Stick.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A holographic watch.

Angry over numerous injuries and some unspecified insult, he plots to murder his friend during Carnival when the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley.\nMontresor lures Fortunato into a private wine-tasting excursion by telling him he has obtained a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of what he believes to be a rare vintage of amontillado. He mentions obtaining confirmation of the pipe's contents by inviting a fellow wine aficionado, Luchesi, for a private tasting. Montresor knows Fortunato will not be able to resist demonstrating his discerning palate for wine and will insist that he taste the amontillado rather than Luchesi who, as he claims, \"cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry\". Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato in order to keep him inebriated. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the damp, and suggests they go back; Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that \"[he] shall not die of a cough.\" During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (\"No one attacks me with impunity\").\nAt one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, \"You are not of the masons?\" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the amontillado is within. Fortunato enters drunk and unsuspecting and therefore, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, Montresor must \"positively leave\" him there.\nMontresor reveals brick and mortar, previously hidden among the bones nearby, and walls up the niche, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated he would, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As the murderer finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, \"For the love of God, Montresor!\" to which Montresor replies, \"Yes, for the love of God!\" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs.\nIn the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that 50 years later, Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: In pace requiescat! (\"May he rest in peace!\").", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "about 130 gallons 492 litres"}], "question": "What is the size of a pipe?

His success at choosing winners catches the eye of Walter Abrams (Pacino), the slick head of one of the biggest sports consulting operations in the United States. Walter takes Brandon under his wing, and soon they are making tremendous amounts of money.\nLang's in-depth knowledge of the game, leagues and players brings in big winnings and bigger clients. Abrams' cable television show, The Sports Advisors, skyrockets in popularity when he adds Lang's slick \"John Anthony\" persona to the desk, infuriating Jerry Sykes (Jeremy Piven), who up to now has been Walter's in-house expert. Lang's total image is remade \u00e2\u0080\u0094 new car, new wardrobe and a new look with the assistance of Walter's wife, Toni (Russo), a hair stylist.\nThings suddenly go south, however, when Lang begins playing his hunches instead of doing his homework. He loses his touch and is even physically assaulted by the thugs of a gambler (Armand Assante) who lost a great deal of money following Lang's advice. Lang and Abrams' once-solid relationship sours.\nLang's new high-rolling lifestyle depends entirely on his ability to predict the outcomes of the games. Millions are at stake by the time he places his last bet, and Abrams grows increasingly unstable. (Abrams is a recovering gambling addict and alcoholic, among other things. Toni tells Lang early on that Walter's life is \"held together by meetings; if there's an 'anonymous' at the end of it, he goes. He has to.\"). He secretly begins gambling all of his own money on Lang's picks and becomes suspicious that Lang is having an affair with his wife.\nThe film concludes with Lang's predictions coming true for the last game, both of which he allegedly determines by flipping coins in a bathroom, as he leaves New York and takes a job as coach of a junior league football team.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "handicapping football games"}], "question": "What is Brandon Langs job?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Walter Abrams"}], "question": "Who takes Brandon under his wing?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Sports Advisors"}], "question": "What is the name of Abrams television show?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jerry Sykes"}], "question": "Who is infuriated that Lang is added to the show?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Walter's wife Toni"}], "question": "Who helped remake Lang's image?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "thugs hired by a gambler who lost on predictions Lang made"}], "question": "Who assaulted Lang?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "his ability to predict games"}], "question": "What does Lang's high rolling lifestyle depend on?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Abrams"}], "question": "Who grows unstable?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "millions"}], "question": "How much is at stake when Lang places his last bet?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Walter Abrams"}], "question": "Who is a gambling addict and an alcoholic?", "id": "ab4aabe1ce1b1377b94331343d7c3bc4037f470b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By flipping coins in a bathroom.

His childhood ends with the death of his mother (he had early lost his father) and with his departure for boarding school in Pisae. As a youth he is befriended by and falls under the influence of a brilliant, hedonistic older boy, Flavianus, who awakens in him a love of literature (the two read with delight the story of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius, and Pater in due course makes Flavian, who is \"an ardent student of words, of the literary art\", the author of the Pervigilium Veneris). Flavian falls ill during the Festival of Isis and Marius tends him during his long death-agony (end of 'Part the First'). Grown to manhood, Marius now embraces the philosophy of the 'flux' of Heraclitus and the Epicureanism (or Cyrenaicism) of Aristippus. He journeys to Rome (166 AD), encountering by chance on the way a blithesome young knight, Cornelius, who becomes a friend. Marius explores Rome in awe, and, \"as a youth of great attainments in Greek letters and philosophy\", is appointed amanuensis to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius's Meditations on Stoicism and on Plato, and the public lectures of the rhetorician Fronto, open Marius' eyes to the narrowness of Epicureanism. Aurelius's indifference, however, to the cruelty to animals in the amphitheatre, and later to the torments inflicted on people there, causes Marius to question the values of Stoicism (end of 'Part the Second'). Disillusioned with Rome and the imperial court which seem \"like some stifling forest of bronze-work, transformed as if by malign enchantment out of the living trees\", puzzled by the source of Cornelius's serenity, still Epicurean by temperament but seeking a more satisfying life-philosophy, Marius makes repeated visits alone to the Campagna and Alban Hills, on one occasion experiencing in the Sabine Hills a sort of spiritual \"epiphany\" on a perfect day of peace and beauty (end of 'Part the Third'). Later he is taken by Cornelius to a household in the Campagna centred on a charismatic young widow, Cecilia, where prevails an atmosphere of peace and love, gradually revealing itself as a new religion with liturgy and rituals that appeal aesthetically and emotionally to Marius. The sense of purposeful community there, set against the persecution of Christians by the authorities and the competing philosophical systems in Rome, contributes to Marius' mood of isolation and emotional failure. Overshadowed by thoughts of mortality he revisits home and pays his respects to the family dead, burying their funerary urns, and sets out again for Rome in Cornelius's company. On the way the two are arrested as part of a sweep of suspected Christians. It emerges that only one of the young men is of this sect, and Marius, unbeknown to Cornelius, makes their captors believe it is he. Cornelius is set free, deceived into thinking that Marius will follow shortly. The latter endures hardship and exhaustion as he journeys captive towards Rome, falls ill, and dying is abandoned by his captors. \"Had there been one to listen just then,\" Pater comments, \"there would have come, from the very depth of his desolation, an eloquent utterance at last, on the irony of men's fates, on the singular accidents of life and death.\"  Marius is tended in his last days by some poor country people, secret believers who take him to be one of their own. Though he has shown little interest in the doctrines of the new faith and dies more or less in ignorance of them, he is nevertheless, Pater implies, \"a soul naturally Christian\" (anima naturaliter christiana ) and he finds peace in his final hours as he reviews his life: \"He would try to fix his mind on all the persons he had loved in life, dead or living, grateful for his love or not. In the bare sense of having loved he seemed to find that on which his soul might 'assuredly rest and depend'. ... And again, as of old, the sense of gratitude seemed to bring with it the sense also of a living person at his side\" (end of 'Part the Fourth').", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "After his mother dies."}], "question": "When does Marius depart for boarding school?", "id": "ad020448b562d244e23b4d9a55fde6b31971f583"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Flavianus."}], "question": "Who makes Marius love literature?", "id": "ad020448b562d244e23b4d9a55fde6b31971f583"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aurelius's cruelty to animals and people."}], "question": "Why does Marius question the values of Stoicism?", "id": "ad020448b562d244e23b4d9a55fde6b31971f583"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marius"}], "question": "Who is assigned amanuensis to Emperor Aurelius?

Best friends since childhood, the two are about to go off to different colleges, as Seth did not get accepted into Dartmouth like Evan. After Seth is paired with Jules (Emma Stone) during Home-Ec class, she invites him to a party at her house later that night. Later, their friend Edward Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) comes up to the two and reveals his plans to obtain a fake ID during lunch. Seth uses this to his advantage and promises to bring alcohol to Jules' party. Meanwhile, Evan runs into his crush Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and he offers to get her some Goldslick vodka for the party. Fogell's fake ID is met with derision by Seth and Evan, as it states that Fogell's name is simply \"McLovin\". After contemplating their options, Seth decides they have no choice but to have Fogell buy the alcohol with his fake ID. Fogell goes in and successfully buys the alcohol, but is interrupted when a robber enters the store, punches him in the face, and takes money from the cash register.\nWhen police officers Slater (Bill Hader) and Michaels (Seth Rogen) arrive to investigate the robbery, Seth and Evan believe that Fogell has been busted for the fake ID. Inside the store, Slater and Michaels are apparently fooled by Fogell's ID and give him a ride to the party. While arguing over what to do, Seth is hit by a car being driven by Francis (Joe Lo Truglio), who promises to take them to a party he is attending in exchange for them not telling the police. During Fogell's time with the police, they exhibit very irresponsible behavior such as drinking on the job, shooting their firearms at a stop sign, and improper use of their sirens to run red lights. All the while, the three develop a strong friendship. When Seth and Evan arrive at the party, they quickly discover that Francis is not welcome there. Francis is brutally beaten by Mark (Kevin Corrigan), the party host, while Seth fills detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol he finds in the fridge.\nAfter running away from the party, Evan and Seth begin to argue, with Seth angrily asking why Evan is going to Dartmouth when he knew Seth would not get accepted. Evan angrily responds that Seth has been holding him back for years and he does not want to miss out because of him. During the argument, Evan pushes Seth in front of the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. Afraid of losing their jobs, the cops decide to frame Seth and Evan by arresting them, but when Fogell comes out of the car, Evan makes a run for it, and Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. While on a bus, a drifter attempts to steal the vodka that Becca wanted, causing it to fall out of Evan's hand and smash on the floor, after which the trio is kicked off. They run to the party, but on the way, Fogell accidentally clues Seth in on his plans to room with Evan the next year. Hurt, Seth takes the alcohol into the party by himself. At the party, Seth becomes popular and Evan tries to connect with Becca, but she is drunk.\nBecca drags Evan upstairs to have sex with him, but he declines and leaves after she vomits next to him on the bed. Meanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola (Aviva Farber) and goes to have sex with her upstairs as well. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because neither does she drink or want to do anything with Seth while he is drunk. Seth then confesses to Jules his plan to hook up with her while they were both intoxicated and become her boyfriend over the summer before they both departed for college and that he has effectively ruined any chance of that happening. Jules tries to reassure him otherwise, but before she can continue, Seth passes out and accidentally headbutts her, leaving her with a bruised eye. Slater and Michaels bust the party and Seth saves an intoxicated Evan by carrying him out. Fogell's lovemaking lasts only a second, before he is interrupted by Slater, who scares Nicola away. Michaels calms down Slater, who is angry at Fogell for ditching them.\nAfter they apologize for \"cock-blocking\" him, they reconcile and reveal they knew Fogell was not 25 the whole time; they had played along, wanting to prove cops can have fun as well. To make it up to Fogell, they pretend to arrest him to boost his popularity, then proceed to drive recklessly and destroy their car with a Molotov cocktail while Fogell shoots it. At Evan's house, Seth and Evan patch things up and declare their friendship for each other. The next morning, they go to the mall to buy stuff for college, where they meet Jules and Becca, and they all reconcile. Seth takes Jules to buy cover up for her bruise, while Evan makes arrangements to go on a date with Becca.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Vomits."}], "question": "What does Becca do next to Evan on a bed?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seth headbutts her."}], "question": "How does Jules get a bruised eye?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He finds out Fogell will room with Evan."}], "question": "Why is Seth hurt by Fogell?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They were afraid they would lose their jobs."}], "question": "Why did the cops frame Seth and Evan?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dartmouth."}], "question": "Where was Evan accepted into college?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jules."}], "question": "Who invited Seth to a party?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Alcohol."}], "question": "What did Seth fill detergent bottles with?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A robber."}], "question": "Who punched Fogell in the face at the liquor store?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A party."}], "question": "Where did Slater and Michaels give Fogell a ride to?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To boost his popularity."}], "question": "Why did the cops pretend to arrest Fogell?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because his name on the fake ID read \"McLovin\""}], "question": "Why were Seth and Even met with derision after seeing Fogells fake ID?", "id": "ad0ec287e1d4d99b7ed905a7765e56f79eecb9ef"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A robber walks into the store, punches Fogell in the face, and robs the cash register.

This book follows Anne from the age of 16 to 18, during the two years that she teaches at Avonlea school. It includes many of the characters from Anne of Green Gables, as well as new ones like Mr. Harrison, Miss Lavendar Lewis, Paul Irving, and the twins Dora and Davy.Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School. The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbor, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora. They are the children of Marilla's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country. Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Davy is Dora's exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly, of course) to know the twins will remain with them.\nOther characters introduced are some of Anne's new pupils, such as Paul Irving, an American boy living with his grandmother in Avonlea while his widower father works in the States. He delights Anne with his imagination and whimsical ways, which are reminiscent of Anne's in her childhood. Later in the book, Anne and her friends meet Miss Lavendar Lewis, a sweet but lonely lady in her 40s who had been engaged to Paul's father 25 years before, but parted from him after a disagreement. At the end of the book, Mr. Irving returns and he and Miss Lavendar marry.\nAnne discovers the delights and troubles of being a teacher, takes part in the raising of Davy and Dora, and organizes the A.V.I.S. (Avonlea Village Improvement Society) together with Gilbert, Diana, and Fred Wright, though their efforts to improve the town are not always successful. The Society takes up a subscription to repaint an old town hall, only to have the painter provide the wrong color of paint, turning the hall into a bright blue eyesore.\nTowards the end of the book, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's husband dies and Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla at Green Gables, allowing Anne to go to college at last. She and Gilbert make plans to attend Redmond College in the fall.\nThis book sees Anne maturing slightly, even though she still cannot avoid getting into a number of her familiar scrapes, as only Anne can\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of which include selling her neighbor's cow (having mistaken it for her own), or getting stuck in a broken duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The twins' mother died"}], "question": "Why did Marilla take in the twins?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Teacher"}], "question": "What is Anne's job?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Her neighbor's"}], "question": "Whose cow did Anne sell?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Go to college"}], "question": "What can Anne do once Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "parrot"}], "question": "What type of pet does Mr. Harrison have?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Avonlea"}], "question": "What is the name of the school where Anne teaches?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His grandmother"}], "question": "With whom does Paul live?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Blue"}], "question": "What color was the town hall painted?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Miss Lavendar"}], "question": "Who does Mr. Irving marry?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Davy and Dora"}], "question": "What are the twins' names?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A teacher."}], "question": "What profession does Anne have as a teenager?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Avonlea school."}], "question": "Where does Anne teach?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Their mother died and their uncle is out of town."}], "question": "Why does Anne agree to take care of the twins Davy and Dora?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She will get to continue to take care of Davy and Dora."}], "question": "Why is Anne relieved when the twins uncle dies?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "one of Anne's students."}], "question": "Who is Paul Irving?", "id": "ae029461fcf47fb7c4e9e2574c7fb936ca29937b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A.V.I.S.

When they leave the convent, however, their lives follow two very different paths. Louise chooses a life of romance, whereas Ren\u00e9e takes a much more pragmatic approach; but their friendship is preserved through their correspondence, which continues for a dozen years from 1823 through 1835.\nLouise is expected to sacrifice herself for her two brothers and take the veil, but the young girl refuses to submit to such a fate. Her dying grandmother intercedes on her behalf and bequeaths her her fortune, thereby rescuing her from the enclosed life of a Carmelite nun and leaving her financially independent. Free to assist her brothers financially without having to sacrifice her own ambitions, Louise settles in Paris and throws herself into a life of Italian operas, masqued balls and romantic intrigues. She falls in love with an unbecoming but noble Spaniard, Felipe H\u00e9narez, Baron de Macumer. Banished from Spain, he lives incognito in Paris where he is forced to support himself by teaching Spanish. When he regains his fortune and noble standing, he woos Louise with a romantic fervour that finally wins her over. The pair are married in March 1825. They live a life of carefree happiness, but Louise's jealousy embitters him and leads to his physical break-down. He dies in 1829, leaving a grieving widow of twenty-four.\nRen\u00e9e de Maucombe's attitude to love and life are in marked contrast to those of Louise. When she leaves the convent at Blois Ren\u00e9e moves to Provence, where she marries an older man of little wealth or standing whom she can hardly be said to love. She bears Louis de L'Estorade three children, and over the course of the next decade she devotes herself body and soul to the happiness of her family. Gradually she grows to love her husband in her own way, and with her encouragement he makes a career for himself in local politics, which culminates in his becoming a peer of France and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. During this time Ren\u00e9e is quite scathing in her criticisms of Louise, whom she sees as a selfish and self-indulgent coquette. True happiness for a woman lies in motherhood and devotion to her family.\nMeanwhile, four years after the death of Felipe, Louise falls in love again. This time the object of her love is a poor poet and playwright Marie Gaston, who is several years younger than she is. As though taking a leaf out of Ren\u00e9e's book, Louise sells her Parisian property, moves to a chalet in Ville d'Avray (a small village near Paris) and lives a life of seclusion with her new husband. But Ren\u00e9e is not fooled by this masquerade. Louise, she warns, is still living a life devoted to selfishness and self-indulgence, while true happiness lies only in self-sacrifice to one's husband and children - Louise remains childless.\nAfter a few years of apparent bliss, Louise detects a change in her husband. He becomes solicitous about the financial success of his plays, and a large sum of money goes missing. Suspecting him of having an expensive mistress, Louise makes enquiries and comes to the shocking conclusion that he has another family in Paris \u2013 an Englishwoman known by the name Madame Gaston, and two children, who look remarkably like Marie. Louise confides her feelings of despair to Ren\u00e9e and announces her determination to commit suicide rather than to submit to such a fate. Ren\u00e9e's husband makes enquiries and discovers the truth of the situation. Madame Gaston is the widow of Marie's brother. The death of her husband has left her financially destitute and Marie has taken it upon himself to assist her and his two nephews, but he is ashamed to ask his wife for money. Rene\u00e9 writes to Louise to inform her of the truth and rushes to the chalet, but she is too late. Louise has contracted consumption by lying out in the dew overnight and she dies a few days later.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A lot of money."}], "question": "What goes

in the wars, for many years; he returns home in triumph, bringing with him Tigranes, the defeated king of Armenia. He intends to marry his sister Panthea to Tigranes. Meanwhile, he learns that his mother, Arane, who hates him, has plotted his assassination. The regent Gobrius has foiled the plot. Tigranes' fiancee Spaconia accompanies him into exile, hoping to avert Arbaces' plans for the marriage alliance. Tigranes promises her he will remain faithful.\nOn his return Arbaces finds that he now has a powerful sexual attraction to his beautiful sister, the princess Panthea, whom he hasn't seen since childhood. Much of the play depicts his increasingly desperate struggle against his incestuous passion. Arbaces blames the protector Gobrius for his predicament; the minister had written Arbaces many letters during the king's years abroad, praising Panthea's beauty and her love for him. Panthea is also attracted to Arbaces, but her virtue restains them both. The king becomes so desperate that he decides to murder Gobrius, rape Panthea, and then commit suicide. Meanwhile, Tigranes too falls in love with Panthea, even though this means he breaks his faith with Spaconia. Tigranes exercises the self-discipline and rationality that Arbaces struggles to achieve, and rededicates himself to Spaconia.\nArbaces' dilemma is resolved when it is revealed that the situation is a complex hoax, staged by Arane and Gobrius to give an heir to the childless old king who was Arbaces' predecessor. Arane's plots against her supposed son were intended to restore the rightful succession. Arbaces is in fact Gobrius's son, and so Panthea is not actually his sister. Gobrius had plotted that his son would become the legitimate king, by marriage with Panthea; Arbaces does marry the princess, but steps down from the kingship.\nArbaces is presented as a mixed character, brave and formidable in battle, but boastful and somewhat vulgar. His character is explained by the trick of his birth: he cannot behave with the nobility of a king, because he isn't one by \"blood.\" The comic relief in the play is provided by the cowardly Bessus and his cronies; their subplot turns on the customs of honorable duelling \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and their comical violation. (Bessus was a well-known comic creation; Queen Henrietta Maria refers to Bessus in a 25 February 1643 letter to her husband, Charles I.)\nA King and No King has a strong degree of commonality with the same authors' Thierry and Theodoret. The former might be regarded as the tragicomic version, and the latter the tragic, of the same story.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arbaces"}], "question": "Who is the King of Iberia?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tigranes"}], "question": "Who defeated the King of Armenia?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His mother Arane"}], "question": "Who wants Arbaces to be assassinated?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Panthea"}], "question": "Who is Arbaces sexually attracted towards?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He raped her"}], "question": "What did the King do to Panthea?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Spaconia"}], "question": "Who is Tigranes engaged to?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arane and Gobrias"}], "question": "Which two people plotted again Arbaces?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arbaces is Gobrias' son"}], "question": "What is Arbaces relationship with Gobrius?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arbaces"}], "question": "Who ultimately steps down from the kingship?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gobrius"}], "question": "Who doese Arbaces blame for falling in love with Panthea?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The king of Armenia"}], "question": "Who is Tigranes?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arbaces"}], "question": "Who defeats Tigranes?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Iberia"}], "question": "What country is Arbaces king of?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Panthea"}], "question": "Who does King Arbaces fall in love with?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is his sister"}], "question": "What is Panthea's relation to Arbaces?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Falling in love with Panthea"}], "question": "What does Arbaces blame Gorbrius for?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Wrote letters to Arbaces describing Panthea's beauty"}], "question": "What did Gorbrius do that made Arbaces love Panthea?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gorbrius"}], "question": "Who is Arbaces' biological father?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To provide an heir to the thone"}], "question": "Why did Gorbrius want Arbaces to love Panthea?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arane"}], "question": "Who decieves Arbaces with Gorbrius?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arbaces."}], "question": "Who is King of Iberia?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He planned to marry Panthea to Tigranes."}], "question": "Why did Arbaces bring Tigranes home with him?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Spaconia"}], "question": "Who went into exile with Tigranes?", "id": "af7a0d8c4451211b245244cb4ac54532b160b5e5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Arane."}], "question": "Who orchestated Arbaces's assassination?

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.\nGrady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.\nDuring a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.\nMeanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Terry is there to see if Grady has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a transvestite whom he met on the flight, called Antonia \"Tony\" Sloviak (Michael Cavadias). The pair apparently become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but, immediately afterwards, Terry meets James and becomes infatuated with him, and Tony is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Terry and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two spending an intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms.\nTired and confused, Grady phones Walter and reveals to him that he is in love with Sara. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and James. The following morning the Pittsburgh Police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. The car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and, over the weekend, Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Over the course of his travel around town, a man claiming to be the car's real owner repeatedly accosted Grady. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife, Oola, in the passenger seat, with the stolen memorabilia.\nGrady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells Oola the story behind the memorabilia and allows her to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James's future, Terry convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book, \"a critical exploration of the union of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American mythopoetics\", tentatively titled The Last American Marriage.\nThe film ends with Grady recounting the eventual fate of the main characters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hannah graduates and becomes a magazine editor; James was not expelled, but drops out and moves to New York to rework his novel for publication; and Terry Crabtree \"goes right on being Crabtree.\" Grady finishes typing his new book (now using a computer rather than a typewriter), which is an account of the events of the film, then watches Sara and their child arriving home before turning back to the computer and clicking \"Save.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hannah Green"}], "question": "Which of Professor Tripp's students live with him?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Prof. Grady Tripp"}], "question": "Whose child is the university chancellor carrying?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "at a party at the Gaskells' house"}], "question": "Where was Jame when he shot a dog?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Emily and Sara"}], "question": "Which two women is Professor Tripp being asked to choose between?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to hide it from the Gaskells"}], "question": "Why did Grady put a dead animal in his car?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Terry meets James"}], "question": "Why is Antonia sent home after arriving at the party?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pittsburgh"}], "question": "Where were Grady's editor and the transvestite going when they met?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "by agreeing to publish Walter's work"}], "question": "How does Terry keep James from being arrested?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "most of it blew out of the car window"}], "question": "What happened to Grady's incomplete manuscript?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the wife of the owner of the car Gary was driving"}], "question": "Who is Oola?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Chancellor of the University"}], "question": "What is Sara's job?", "id": "b08882a8306a6a4b1f405827ee19b4aca538c023"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marilyn Monroe"}], "question": "What celebrity's memorabilia did James steal from the Gaskell's home?

His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.\nThe hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.\nThe narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years previously to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an \"all-permeating fluid\" called \"Vril\", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.\nMen (called An, pronounced \"Arn\") and women (called Gy-ei, pronounced \"Jy-ei\") have equal rights. The women are as strong as, if not stronger than the men. They marry for just three years, after which they are free to remarry or to remain single.\nTheir religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.\nThe narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.",

They had three children together, two girls and a boy, who are grown. Jake, who was cheating on Jane, married the much younger Agness (Lake Bell).\nJane and Jake attend their son Luke's graduation from college in New York City. After a dinner together, the two begin an affair, which continues in Santa Barbara. Jane is torn about the affair; Jake is not. While Agness has Jake scheduled for regular sessions at a fertility clinic, Jake is secretly taking medication, a side effect of which reduces his sperm count. After one of his sessions he has a lunchtime rendezvous with Jane at a hotel. Jake collapses in the hotel room and a doctor is called. The doctor speculates that the reason for Jake's distress may be the medication and says he should stop taking it. Jake and Jane's children know nothing of the affair, but Harley (John Krasinski), who is engaged to their daughter Lauren, spots the pair and the doctor in the hotel, but keeps silent.\nAdam (Steve Martin) is an architect hired to remodel Jane's home. Still healing from a divorce of his own, he begins to fall in love with Jane. On the night of Luke's graduation party in Santa Barbara, Jane invites Adam to the party. She is stoned when he picks her up because she has smoked a marijuana joint that Jake had given her earlier. Later at the party, Adam also smokes a joint with Jane. Jake becomes jealous observing them, but with some cajoling by Jane, he gets stoned with them as well.\nAgness then observes Jake and Jane dancing together and becomes suspicious of their closeness. When they leave the party, Adam asks Jane if they could have something to eat. Jane takes him to her bakery and they make chocolate croissants together. Jake and Agness separate, although it is not clear who leaves whom. Eventually by a webcam in Jane's bedroom, Adam sees Jake naked and realizes that the two have been having an affair. Adam tells Jane he cannot continue seeing her because it will only lead to heartbreak. Jane's kids also find out, and they are not happy about Mom and Dad getting together again because they are still recovering from the divorce. Jane tells them she is not getting back with Jake. Jane and Jake talk and end their affair on amicable terms. The film ends with Adam at Jane's house ready to commence the remodeling.

He goes into politics, railing against the corruptly run county government, but loses his race for county treasurer, in the face of unfair obstacles placed by the local machine. Stark teaches himself law, and as a lawyer, continues to fight the local establishment, championing the local people and gaining popularity. He eventually rises to become a candidate for governor, narrowly losing his first race, then winning on his second attempt. Along the way he loses his innocence and becomes as corrupt as the politicians he once fought against. When his son becomes paralyzed following a drunk driving accident that kills a female passenger, Stark's world starts to unravel and he discovers that not everyone can be bought off.\nThe story has a complex series of relationships. All is seen through the eyes of the journalist, Jack Burden, who admires Stark and even when disillusioned still sticks by him. Stark's campaign assistant, Sadie is clearly in love with Stark and wants him to leave his wife, Lucy. Meanwhile, Stark philanders and gets involved with many women, taking Jack's own girlfriend, Anne Stanton, as his mistress. When Stark's reputation is brought into disrepute by Judge Stanton (Anne's uncle), he seeks to blacken the judge's name. When Jack finds evidence of the judge's possible wrongdoing, a quarter century earlier, he hides it from Stark. Anne gives the evidence to Stark, who uses it against her uncle, who immediately commits suicide. Anne seems to forgive Stark, but her brother, the surgeon who helped save Stark's son's life after the car crash, cannot. The doctor eventually assassinates Stark after Stark wins an impeachment investigation. The doctor in turn is shot down by Sugar Boy, Stark's fawning assistant.\nThe main plot is a thinly disguised version of the rise of real-life 1930s Louisiana Governor, Huey Long, Long's efforts to blacken the name of Judge Benjamin Pavy, and Long's assassination by the Judge's son-in-law (compared to nephew, as in the film), Dr. Carl Weiss.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

owned by a six-year-old boy, Andy Davis (John Morris), are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his single mother (Laurie Metcalf) and infant sister Molly are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, an old fashioned cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess (Annie Potts), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey), spy on the party and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who believes that he is an actual space ranger.\nBuzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring only one toy along. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up knocking him out a window instead, resulting in the other toys accusing Woody of murdering Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact punishment, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on the car as well, and the two fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are picked out by Andy's destructive neighbor Sid Phillips (Erik von Detten).\nWoody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally discovering he is a toy, sinks into despondence. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next morning, Woody and Sid's mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him. Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase. Woody tries rescuing Buzz with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, thinking Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC pick up Woody and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.\nOn Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Molly"}], "question": "What's the name of Andy's younger sister?", "id": "b31c8b60d28467403c1615ec883b167a0c103835"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Andy's birthday party.

During the revolution he took part in the Royalist 13 Vend\u00e9miaire uprising against the Republic, at one stage confronting Napoleon Bonaparte himself, and he mentions this often in conversation. He is married to Constance and has a daughter Cesarine. He plans to throw a ball at his home, and make renovations to his home for the ball.

He plans to expand his business with a new hair oil product, with his assistant Anselme Popinot (who is in love with Cesarine) as his business partner. All of these plans have caused him to run up large debts.\nWhat he does not realise is that Roguin has money problems of his own, and that C\u00e9sar's former shop assistant Ferdinand du Tillet, now a banker, is manipulating Roguin in order to have revenge against C\u00e9sar. His financial situation becomes a crisis when Roguin absconds and leaves C\u00e9sar with debts that he is not able to pay.

"b510383c844f4f423a9e5ca63daa4b665916aa96", "paragraphs": [{"context": " The first act takes place outside a spa overlooking a fjord. Sculptor Arnold Rubek and his wife Maia have just enjoyed breakfast and are reading newspapers and drinking champagne. They marvel at how quiet the spa is. Their conversation is lighthearted, but Arnold hints at a general unhappiness with his life. Maia also hints at disappointment. Arnold had promised to take her to a mountaintop to see the whole world as it is, but they have never done so.\nThe hotel manager passes by with some guests and inquires if the Rubeks need anything. During their encounter, a mysterious woman dressed in white passes by, followed closely by a nun in black. Arnold is drawn to her for some reason. The manager does not know much about her, and he tries to excuse himself before Squire Ulfheim can spot him. Unable to do so, Ulfheim corners him and requests breakfast for his hunting dogs. Spotting the Rubeks, he introduces himself and mocks their plans to take a cruise, insisting that the water is too contaminated by other people. He is stopping at the spa on his way to a mountain hunt for bears, and he insists that the couple should join him, as the mountains are unpolluted by people.\nMaia takes Ulfheim up on his offer to watch his dogs eat breakfast, leaving Arnold alone with the mysterious woman. He quickly realizes that she is Irena, his former model. Irena constantly refers to herself as being 'dead'. During their conversation, she explains that posing for Arnold was akin to a kind of 'self murder', where he captured her soul and put it into his masterpiece, a sculpture called 'Resurrection'. He confesses that he has never been the same since working with Irena. Though 'Resurrection' brought him great fame and an abundance of other work, he feels a similar kind of death as Irena feels.\nIrena mysteriously alludes to killing all of her lovers since posing for Arnold. She claims to always possess a knife, and also admits to murdering every child she has had, sometimes while they are still in the womb. When Irena asks where Arnold is going after his stay at the spa, she dismisses the idea of the cruise and asks him to meet her up in the high mountains. Maia returns with Ulfheim, asking Arnold if they can abandon the cruise and join Ulfheim on his mountain hunt. Arnold tells her that she is free to do so and says that he is thinking of going that way himself.\nThe second act takes place outside a health resort in the mountains. Maia finds Arnold beside a brook. She has spent the morning with Ulfheim. The couple return to their discussion of Arnold's unhappiness, and he confesses that he has grown tired of Maia. He wants to live with Irena because she had the key to the lock which holds his artistic inspiration. Their relationship was never sexual, because Arnold felt it would have ruined 'Resurrection'. Maia is hurt but insists that Arnold should do as he pleases. She even suggests that perhaps the three of them could live together if she cannot find a new place to live.\nIrena enters, and Maia urges Arnold to speak with her. The pair cast flower petals into the brook and reminisce sentimentally about their long-ago collaboration. At one point, Arnold refers to their 'episode', and Irena draws her knife, preparing to stab him in the back. When he turns around, she hides the knife. Arnold asks Irena to come live with him and work with him again, explaining that she can unlock his artistic vision once more. She insists that there is no way to resurrect a partnership like theirs, but they agree to pretend they can. Maia returns with Ulfheim, on their way to a hunt. She is happy and explains that she feels like she is finally awake. She sings a little song to herself, \"I am free...No longer in prison, I'll be! I'm as free as a bird, I am free!\"\nThe final act takes place on the rocky mountainside, with narrow paths and a shabby hunting hut. Maia and Ulfheim enter already in an argument over his sexual advances. Maia demands to be taken down to the resort. Ulfheim points out that the path is too difficult for her and she will surely die on her own. Arnold and Irena come up the path from the resort. Ulfheim is surprised that they have made it on their own, since the path is so difficult. He warns them that a storm is coming. Since he can only guide one person at a time, he agrees to take Maia down the path, and urges Irena and Arnold to take shelter in the hut until he can return with help.\nIrena is horrified at being rescued. She is convinced that the nun will commit her to an asylum. She draws the knife again to kill herself. Arnold insists that she should not. Irena confesses that she almost killed him earlier, but she stopped because she realized he was already dead. She explains that the love that belongs to their earthly life is dead in both of them. However, Arnold points out that they are both still free, insisting that \"we two dead things live life for once to the full\". Irena agrees but urges that they must do it above the clouds of the gathering storm. They agree to climb the mountain so that they can be married by the sunlight. As they happily ascend out of view, Maia's song is heard in the distance. Suddenly, an avalanche roars down the mountain. Arnold and Irene can be seen carried to their deaths. The nun has followed Irena up the mountain and witnesses the horror with a scream. After a moment of silence, she says \"Pax vobiscum!\" (Peace be with you), as Maia's song still lingers in the air.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To take her to a mountaintop.

Wealthy, fashionable people went there to \"take the waters\", which were believed to have healing properties. Bath was much less exclusive than London, and hence it provides an ideal setting for the characters.\nThe plot centres on the two young lovers, Lydia and Jack. Lydia, who reads a lot of popular novels of the time, wants a purely romantic love affair. To court her, Jack pretends to be \"Ensign Beverley\", a poor officer. Lydia is enthralled with the idea of eloping with a poor soldier in spite of the objections of her guardian, Mrs. Malaprop, a moralistic widow. Mrs. Malaprop is the chief comic figure of the play, thanks to her continual misuse of words that sound like the words she intends to use, but mean something completely different. (The term malapropism was coined in reference to the character.)\nLydia has two other suitors: Bob Acres (a somewhat buffoonish country gentleman), and Sir Lucius O'Trigger, an impoverished and combative Irish gentleman. Sir Lucius pays Lucy to carry love notes between him and Lydia (who uses the name \"Delia\"), but Lucy is swindling him: \"Delia\" is actually Mrs. Malaprop.\nAs the play opens, Sir Anthony arrives suddenly in Bath. He has arranged a marriage for Jack, but Jack demurs, saying he is in love already. They quarrel violently. But Jack soon learns through the gossip of Lucy and Fag that the marriage arranged by Sir Anthony is, in fact, with Lydia. He makes a great show of submission to his father, and is presented to Lydia with Mrs. Malaprop's blessing. Jack confides to Lydia that he is only posing as Sir Anthony's son. She annoys Mrs. Malaprop by loudly professing her eternal devotion to \"Beverley\" while rejecting \"Jack Absolute\".\nJack's friend Faulkland is in love with Julia, but he suffers from jealous suspicion. He is constantly fretting himself about her fidelity. Faulkland and Julia quarrel foolishly, making elaborate and high-flown speeches about true love that satirise the romantic dramas of the period.\nBob Acres tells Sir Lucius that another man (\"Beverley\") is courting the lady of Acres' choice (Lydia, though Sir Lucius does not know this). Sir Lucius immediately declares that Acres must challenge \"Beverley\" to a duel and kill him. Acres goes along, and writes out a challenge note \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite his own rather more pacifist feelings, and the profound misgivings of his servant David. Sir Lucius leaves, Jack arrives, and Acres tells him of his intent. Jack agrees to deliver the note to \"Beverley\", but declines to be Acres' second.\nMrs. Malaprop again presents Jack to Lydia, but this time with Sir Anthony present, exposing Jack's pose as \"Beverley\". Lydia is enraged by the puncturing of her romantic dreams, and spurns Jack contemptuously.\nSir Lucius has also learned of the proposed marriage of Jack and Lydia, and determines to challenge Jack. He meets Jack, who, smarting from Lydia's rejection, agrees to fight him without even knowing the reason. They will meet at the same time as Acres is scheduled to fight \"Beverley\".\nAt the duelling ground, Acres is very reluctant to fight, but Sir Lucius will have no shirking. Jack and Faulkland arrive. Acres learns that \"Beverley\" is actually his friend Jack, and begs off from their duel. However, Jack is quite willing to fight Sir Lucius, and they cross swords.\nDavid informs Mrs. Malaprop, Lydia, Julia, and Sir Anthony of the dueling, and they all rush off to stop it. Sir Lucius explains the cause of his challenge, but Lydia denies any connection to him, and admits her love for Jack. Mrs. Malaprop announces that she is Delia, but Sir Lucius recoils in horror, realising that he has been hoaxed. Sir Anthony consoles Mrs. Malaprop, Julia is reconciled to Faulkland, and Acres invites everyone to a party.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In 18th century Bath."}], "question": "Where does the story take place?", "id": "b61541153e7d52f0238fb8014efbad42728143fa"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jack."}], "question": "Who does Lydia fall in love with?", "id": "b61541153e7d52f0238fb8014efbad42728143fa"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ensign Beverley, a poor officer.

Abby firmly believes in true love and is a big supporter of complex self-help books such as Chicken Soup for the Soul and Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. Coming home from a disastrous date, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, The Ugly Truth, featuring Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), whose cynicism about relationships prompts Abby to call in to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers the TV station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings. The station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show.\nAt first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds her to be naive and a control freak. Nevertheless, when she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin (Eric Winter) living next to her, Mike convinces her that by following his advice she will improve her chances with Colin. Abby is skeptical, but they make a deal: If Mike's management of her courtship results in her landing Colin, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to leave her show.\nMike succeeds in improving the ratings, brings married co-anchors Georgia and Larry closer and successfully instructs Abby to be exactly what Colin would want through a number of pointers including: always laugh at his jokes and say he is amazing in bed. Mike is invited to appear on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and is offered a job at another network. Abby is forced to cancel a romantic weekend away with Colin, during which they had planned to finally sleep together, and instead fly to Los Angeles to persuade Mike to stay with her show.\nThey drink and dance and Mike admits he does not want to move because he wants to stay in Sacramento near his sister and nephew. In the hotel elevator, they passionately kiss, but go to their separate rooms. Mike, dealing with the intensity of his feelings for Abby, calls on her room only to find Colin has shown up to surprise her. Mike leaves. Abby is upset and soon realizes Colin only likes the woman she has been pretending to be, not the real her. She breaks up with him.\nMike quits and takes a job with a rival TV station in Sacramento, and ends up doing a broadcast at the same hot air balloon festival as Abby. He cannot resist intruding when she kicks the new \"Mike Chadway\" imitator off the air and goes into a tirade about what cowardly weaklings men are. The balloon takes off while they argue. Abby says she broke up with Colin, and Mike admits he loves her. Abby kisses him while they fly off, all of which is broadcast due to a camera mounted in the balloon. The film ends with Abby and Mike in bed. When Mike asks if she was faking it, Abby responds, \"You will never know it.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "morning show TV producer"}], "question": "What is Abby's profession?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "calls in to argue with him on-air"}], "question": "After a disasterous date, what does Abby do after listening to Mike's show the Ugly Truth?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mike agrees to leave Abbey's show."}], "question": "If Mike's advice fails to help Abby land Colin, what has Mike agreed to do?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The ratings improve."}], "question": "What happens to Abby's show's ratings after Mike starts his segment?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She should laugh at all of his jokes."}], "question": "Based on Mike's advice, what should Abby do in response to jokes from Collin?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Los Angeles"}], "question": "Where does Abby fly to attempt to get Mike to stay with her show?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Collin"}], "question": "When Abby is in Los Angeles, who shows up to surprise her?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "the elevator"}], "question": "Where in the hotel are Mike and Abby when they first kiss?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a rival tv station"}], "question": "After Mike quits Abby's show, where does he take a job?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "in the balloon at the Balloon Festival"}], "question": "Where are Mike and Abbey when MIke admits he loves Abbey?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sacramento"}], "question": "What city does the story take place in?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Ugly Truth"}], "question": "What is the name of the television program that the main character first sees?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mike"}], "question": "Who has the station manager hired to do a segment on the main characters show?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Colin"}], "question": "Which person lives next door to the main character?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mike"}], "question": "Which person advises the main characters love life?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mike and Abby"}], "question": "What two characters kiss in an elevator?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hot air balloon"}], "question": "What kind of festival is used near the end of the story?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Abby"}], "question": "Who is forced to cancel a romantic evening?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "California"}], "question": "What State does this story take place in?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Craig Ferguson"}], "question": "What well know late night talk show host is featured in this story?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Abby Ritcher"}], "question": "What is the name of the protagonist in the story?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Abby is a producer for a morning television show."}], "question": "What is Abby's occupation in the story?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The host of The Ugly Truth"}], "question": "Who is Mike Chadway?", "id": "b6ed74a969cdbb5ddc34575df8b7ee9d955d5556"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mike's cynicism about relationships.

But word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger), is being relieved of command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off (\"The Old Man\").\nAfter the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers. They mount their newest hit musical titled Playing Around. The same day they receive a letter from \"Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy,\" their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.\nWhen they go to the club to watch the act (\"Sisters\"), Phil notices that Bob is smitten with Betty (Rosemary Clooney), while Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy (Vera-Ellen). Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and Phil dances with Judy so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other. Phil and Judy hit it off (\"The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing\").\nJudy and Betty head for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train to Vermont.\nWhen the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a snowflake in sight, and chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because there's no snow and thus no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical Playing Around, and add in Betty and Judy. Bob and Betty's relationship blooms (\"Count Your Blessings\") and they spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. He decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.\nBob calls Ed Harrison (Johnny Grant), an old army buddy, now a successful variety show host, to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis. Unbeknownst to Bob, nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (Mary Wickes) was eavesdropping, but she only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea.\nMistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast, Emma reveals what she heard to a shocked Betty. The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold toward a baffled Bob. Meanwhile, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer.\nPhil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony, and Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's coldness, follows Betty to New York. Bob sees Betty's new act (\"Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me\") and reveals the truth about the engagement, but is called away by Ed Harrison before learning what is really bothering her. Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement.\nOn the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve (\"What Can You Do with a General\"). Betty catches Bob's televised pitch and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of \"The Old Man.\" Just as the following number (\"Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army\") ends, he learns that snow is finally falling.\nIn the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, everyone raises a glass, and toasts, \"May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The 151st division"}], "question": "Who does Bob and Phil perform for?", "id": "b961b2d182f89c9c4259ffd8001df871ead32ef0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Major General Thomas Waverly"}], "question": "Who is being removed from command?", "id": "b961b2d182f89c9c4259ffd8001df871ead32ef0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Dog faced boy"}], "question": "What is Freckle Faced Haynes also called?", "id": "b961b2d182f89c9c4259ffd8001df871ead32ef0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Betty"}], "question": "Who does Bob take a liking to at the club?", "id": "b961b2d182f89c9c4259ffd8001df871ead32ef0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Judy"}], "question": "Who does Phil hit it off with?", "id": "b961b2d182f89c9c4259ffd8001df871ead32ef0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pine Tree"}], "question": "When they go to Vermont, what city are Judy and Betty performing in?

Joseph), on a Native American reservation in South Dakota. Agent William Dawes, Ray's superior, has chosen him for the task due to his mixed Sioux heritage, which might assist in the inquiry as they interview local townspeople. Ray is partnered with agent Frank \"Cooch\" Coutelle, who has diligently worked on the probe looking to apprehend a prime suspect: Aboriginal Rights Movement radical Jimmy Looks Twice. While helping Cooch track down the suspect, Ray gradually becomes sensitized to Indian issues, partially from his attraction to Maggie Eagle Bear, a Native American political activist and schoolteacher.\nMocked and ridiculed by the locals (being called a \"Washington Redskin\"), including tribal police officer Walter Crow Horse, Ray finds that he has an unaccountable standing with some of the tribal elders such as Grandpa Sam Reaches. The natives recognize Ray as \"Thunderheart\", a Native American hero slain at the Wounded Knee Massacre in the past, and now reincarnated to deliver them from their current troubles.\nMuch to Cooch's anger, Ray comes to suspect there is a conspiracy and cover-up involving the small town. He and Crow Horse later discover that a local government-sponsored plan to strip mine uranium on the reservation is at the root of the killings. The mining is polluting the water supply and fueling a bloody conflict between the reservation's anti-government ruling council and the pro-government natives who, led by tribal council president Jack Milton, are not above using violence to further their aims. Milton does not own the land where the mining occurs, but gets kickbacks from the leases. Cooch is later revealed to be part of the scandal to silence the opposition and help broker the land deal. Soon after finding Maggie Eagle Bear and former convict Richard Yellow Hawk murdered, a showdown ensues between Cooch and pro-government collaborators against Ray, Crow Horse and the anti-government activists. Cooch becomes outnumbered by the armed resistance and is later investigated on charges of corruption.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Leo Fast Elk"}], "question": "Whose murder is

Early in Riders of the Purple Sage, Jane Withersteen's main conflict is her right to befriend a Gentile. (The word Gentile means \"non-Mormon\" and is used a lot in the book). Jane Withersteen\u2019s father wished Jane to marry Elder Tull, but Jane refused saying she did not love him, causing controversy and leading to persecution by the local Mormons.\nJane\u2019s friend, (cowboy) Bern Venters is \"arrested\" by Tull and his men, but is not clear under what authority. Jane defends Venters, declaring him her best rider. Her churchmen refuse to value the opinion of a woman:\n\"Tull lifted a shaking finger toward her. 'That'll do from you. Understand, you'll not be allowed to hold this boy [Venters] to a friendship that's offensive to your bishop. Jane Withersteen, your father left you wealth and power. It has turned your head. You haven't yet come to see the place of Mormon women ...'\"\nIt is here we first hear of Lassiter. Ironically, at the moment when Venters mentions Lassiter\u2019s name, the actual Lassiter is seen approaching in the distance by Tull\u2019s men.\nUpon his arrival, Lassiter expresses his trust in the word of women, at which Tull rebukes him, telling him not to meddle in Mormon affairs. Tull\u2019s men begin to take Venters away, and Venters realizes who he is and screams \"Lassiter!\" Tull understands that this is the infamous Lassiter and flees.\nLassiter inquires as to the location of Millie Erne's grave, to which a transfixed Jane agrees to take him. Venters later tells Jane he must leave her. When she protests, Venters delivers this statement: \" ... Tull is implacable. You ought to see from his intention today that ... but you can't see. Your blindness ... your damned religion! Jane, forgive me ... I'm sore within and something rankles. Well, I fear that invisible hand [of Mormon power in the region] will turn its hidden work to your ruin.\", showing that Venters could see far into the future, and although Jane rebukes his statement, he is indeed correct.\nJane\u2019s red herd is rustled shortly afterward and Venters tracks it and returns it to Jane. Bern finds the herd, but, in his travels, wages a gun battle with two of Oldring\u2019s rustlers, killing one and managing to wound Oldring\u2019s notorious Masked Rider. Upon further examination, he removes the mask and shirt of the wounded rider and learns that the Masked Rider is a young woman named Bess whom he believes had been abused by Oldring. Venters experiences a large amount of guilt about shooting a girl and decides that it is his duty to save her.\nVenters discovers Surprise Valley and Balancing Rock, where he takes Bess, the girl he has found. Bess gradually gains health and begins to fall in love with Venters who begins to fall in love with Bess. Each explain their individual stories ambiguously, but through Venters' dedicated care for Bess, the pair forms a mutual love that leads to their resolve to marry. Bess also discovered the truth concerning Oldring\u2019s rustlers, who rustled cattle only to disguise their true lifestyle of surviving off gold in the streams and business deals with the Mormons.\nVenters then determines that there is a need for supplies warranting a trip back to Cottonwoods. On his way, Venters sees Jane Withersteen\u2019s prize horses being stolen. He kills the thieves and retrieves the horses for Jane, but unfortunately loses his horse, Wrangle.\nJane\u2019s horses are returned to her, and are locked in the entry hall to Withersteen's house. Venters officially breaks his friendship with Jane at this time. He goes into the village and proclaimed that he was breaking his friendship and leaving. After he leaves, Jane\u2019s other herd gets stolen.\nJane at first pretends to love Lassiter \u2014 knowing he came to Utah to avenge his sister Milly Erne \u2014 to prevent him from murdering Mormon elders she knew were guilty. The two characters grow to love each other. Then Jane's adopted daughter Fay is kidnapped and Lassiter kills Bishop Dyer while risking his own life.\nThe four main characters \u2014 Venters, Bess, Lassiter, and Jane \u2014 realize that they can no longer safely stay in Utah. Lassiter convinces Jane to prepare to leave with him, Lassiter determines the name of a Mormon who contributed to the ruin of Milly and Jane implicates her father in the proselytizing of Milly. In a state of shock, Jane packs.\nMeanwhile, in Surprise Valley, Venters and Bess are preparing to leave as Jane and Lassiter departing, except on burros. Lassiter sets fire to Withersteen House and flees on horseback with Jane. They encounter Venters and Bess in travel. Before they part, Lassiter explains that Bess is not really Bess Oldring, but actually Elizabeth Erne, the lost daughter of Milly Erne.\nJane gives Venters her horses, Venters and Bess gallop for Venters' Illinois home, and Lassiter and Jane find refuge in Venters' valley paradise. On the way, Lassiter rescues Fay, but they are pursued to Surprise Valley. As Tull and his men begin to climb up the cliffside, Jane shouts to Lassiter to \"roll the stone,\" which he does. The ensuing avalanche closes the outlet to Deception Pass \"forever.\" (This is, of course, not true, as Jane, Lassiter, and Fay return in Grey's sequel, The Rainbow Trail/The Desert Crucible.)",

Stu is in love with a sleep institute worker named Dr. Julie McElroy, who helped him deal with his terrible nightmares by changing his drawing hand. One night, Stu crashes his car after accidentally activating an inflatable Monkeybone raft, causing him to fall into a coma.\nHis spirit ends up in Down Town, a limbo-like carnival landscape populated by human beings, mythical creatures and figments of people's imaginations where nightmares are entertainment. In Down Town, Monkeybone is real. During that time, Stu befriends a catgirl named Miss Kitty. When Stu learns that his sister Kimmy is about to pull the plug on him, he asks Hypnos, God of Sleep, for advice. Hypnos tells Stu that to get back to the living, he has to infiltrate the Land of Death to steal an Exit Pass from Death which are given out to coma victims by Reapers giving them permission to leave Down Town and awaken from their coma. Stu successfully steals an Exit Pass, but Monkeybone steals it from him in turn and enters the Land of the Living in Stu's body through the Revive-O as Hypnos states that they have plans for Stu's body.\nWhen Stu is locked up, Hypnos later visits the jail cells, where Stu finds himself locked up with Attila the Hun, Jack the Ripper, and Stephen King, who reveals his nightmare of Cujo pulled the same trick Monkeybone pulled on Stu. Hypnos explains to Stu that he plans to use Stu's body to get a chemical substance named Oneirix that Julie developed that gives people and animals nightmares, which gives him more power. Upon being sent to the institute by Hypnos upon reminding him of his mission, Monkeybone (in Stu's body) ends up successfully stealing the Oneirix, switching it with another juice. Monkeybone obtains the Oneirix and puts it inside stuffed monkey toys of himself (Monkeybone) so that those who touch them will be infected and given nightmares. With help from Miss Kitty, Stu escapes from his imprisonment.\nMonkeybone in Stu's body prepares a pinata for the Monkeybone farting dolls at the party. Meanwhile, Stu reveals Hypnos' plan to Death upon capture and convinces her to send him back for only an hour, only to find himself in the body of a dead athlete organ donor. As he flees the morgue attendants, Stu finds out about Monkeybone's planned party and heads there with the extractors still in pursuit. At the party, Stu's agent, Herb, exposes himself to the Oneirix in the Monkeybone doll and ends up seeing in the mirror that his clothes are coming to life. This causes Herb to run through the party naked, telling everyone that the clothes have come to life and turned evil. After that, Monkeybone in Stu's body tells everyone to forget about it as he brings down the Stu pi\u5358ata containing the Monkeybone dolls. Stu uses Monkeybone's main characteristics from the comics to cause him to panic and escape. A chase ensues, culminating with Stu and Monkeybone battling each other while clinging to a giant Monkeybone balloon. The balloon is eventually shot down by a passing incompetent police officer and both Stu and Monkeybone fall barely enough to be non-fatal and fall unconscious.\nStu and Monkeybone are falling toward Down Town where the residents cheer on their fight. Just then, all the rides stop and a giant robot emerges near the Revive-O causing everyone to flee the area. When Stu and Monkeybone are caught by it, the operator of the robot is revealed to be Death, who seems quite cheerful despite the circumstances. Monkeybone tries to have Death let him go to the bathroom, but Death places Monkeybone back in Stu's head which is where he belongs. Death then uses her robot to send Stu back to the living and he wakes up in his own body. Stu then proposes to Julie and they get married. An erratic Herb breaks the fourth wall urging the audience to take off their clothes and the film cuts to an animated sequence where cartoon characters strip their human disguises revealing monkeys underneath.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he is involved in a car accident?

Born free in Mississippi, she and her brother Harry are the children of a wealthy white planter and his mixed-race wife, a former slave whom he freed and married before the American Civil War. (Note: Such interracial marriage was then illegal, although planters wealthy enough sometimes flouted the law). Her father sends Iola to the North to be educated. After his death, Iola is kidnapped, told that she has black blood, and sold into slavery in the Deep South.\nIn a plot that follows the conventions of the late nineteenth century tragic mulatto genre, Iola struggles to elude the intentions of her various owners to use her sexually. After she is freed by the Union Army during the war, she seeks to find her scattered family members. Embracing her African heritage, she works to improve the social and economic condition of blacks in the United States.\nIola is supported in her struggle by people who relate to various aspects of her complicated life: a devoted former Leroy family slave, Tom Anderson, rescued Iola from a lecherous master. Her brother Harry Leroy joins her in refusing to \"pass\" as white, although that would make life easier for them. (Note: Both Leroys have a majority of white ancestry.) She meets a newfound uncle, Robert Johnson, who introduces her to her dark-skinned maternal grandmother Harriet, of mostly African descent.\nAfter the war, Leroy continues to identify as black. She declines to pass for white when her New England suitor, Dr. Gresham, makes it a condition of his proposal of marriage. He wants her to promise never to reveal her African ancestry.\nLeroy marries Dr. Frank Latimer, a man of mixed ancestry who also identifies with the black community.

The boy's twin brother Jacob, a boy with a huge birthmark (also played by Donovan), decides to seek revenge against the bullies. Leonard (Jesse Camacho) who's overweight, survives the tree house fire but loses his sense of taste and smell. Thanks to the fire, this prompts Leonard to go on a diet, which isn't welcomed by his obese family. The boys' female friend Malee (Zoe Weizenbaum) tries to befriend an adult named Gus (Jeremy Renner), a grief-stricken patient of her therapist mother, Carla (Annabella Sciorra). Jacob's family falls apart after the death of his brother. But shortly after, his parents adopt a boy named Keith Gardner. Meanwhile, Malee begins to have a crush on Gus and changes the song for her recital to one Gus liked, just for him. As time goes by, she sees Gus as her \"soul mate\". She sneaks into his house one night to find him grieving. Afraid to confront him, Malee steals his gun and leaves. She gives it to Jacob the following day.\nJacob frequently visits Jeff and Kenny, who are serving time in a juvenile hall. Jacob initially threatens them, until eventually Jeff commits suicide. Jacob befriends Kenny, soon learning he has an early release and is illegally moving to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Leonard's father decides to take his sisters to Florida instead of Leonard (who would usually go). Leonard decides to force his mother to lose weight by trapping her in the cellar. They both end up in the hospital after a gas leak in their home. Next, Jacob and Kenny agree that Jacob can go with him to New Mexico. Malee visits Gus and removes her clothes in an attempt to seduce him. Instead, Gus calls Malee's mother to come and pick her up. The next day, Gus explains to therapist Carla about the last fire he ever fought (which involved killing an injured little girl, upon the girl's request), claiming that Malee wanted him to take her pain away, as he was aware of her growing crush on him.\nMeanwhile, Jacob's mother tells him that Keith Gardner wasn't adopted to replace Rudy, and that she wants Kenny dead, which reminds Jacob of his planned revenge.

talented, tough, attractive women who work as private investigators together for an unseen millionaire named Charlie (voiced by John Forsythe). Charlie uses a speaker in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant Bosley (Bill Murray) works with them directly when needed.\nCharlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot the Creepy Thin Man (Crispin Glover) who was seen on the surveillance videos during Knox's kidnapping. They chase and fight the Creepy Thin Man, but he runs away. When they follow him, they discover Knox.\nAfter the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Creepy Thin Man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, end up in making love but he betrays her later that night, explaining that he faked the kidnapping with help from Vivian and the Creepy Thin Man. He has kidnapped Bosley, and, with access to Redstar's central computer, he intends to use his voice software with the Redstar satellite network to find and kill Charlie, who he believes had killed his father in the Vietnam War.\nKnox shoots at Dylan, seemingly killing her, but she escapes unharmed. Natalie and Alex are also attacked, and Corwin is murdered by the Creepy Thin Man. When the Angels regroup together, all uninjured, Charlie's offices are blown up. A radio receiver survives in the rubble, and Natalie deduces Bosley's location as he speaks to the Angels using a radio transmitter implanted in his teeth, explaining how to spot his location where he is being held captive.\nWith help from Dylan's current boyfriend The Chad (Tom Green), the Angels approach the abandoned lighthouse where Knox is holding Bosley prisoner. The Angels rescue Bosley and defeat Vivian, the Creepy Thin Man, and some henchmen before Knox blows up the lighthouse, but Knox uses his software and the Redstar satellite network to locate Charlie when he telephones Bosley. When Knox programs a helicopter with a missile towards Charlie's house, Bosley helps the Angels board the helicopter, and Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards, which blows up the helicopter and kills Knox while all of the Angels land safely together on the beach.\nSeeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the beach house that Knox had targeted the missile at, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie tells them that Knox's father was undercover; however, he was discovered and he was killed by someone else but not Charlie. When he speaks to the Angels unseen again by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan then suspects that she might be seeing him nearby talking into a cell phone, but she doesn't tell the group.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Charlie uses speakers in his

[{"context": " The Ozunu Clan, led by the ruthless Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi), trains orphans from around the world to become the ultimate ninja assassins. One of these orphans, Raizo (Rain), was enrolled in the clan's brutal training to become its next successor. The only kindness he was ever shown was from a young kunoichi named Kiriko, with whom he eventually develops a romantic bond. As time goes on, Kiriko becomes disenchanted with the Ozunu's routine and wishes to abandon it for freedom. One rainy night, Kiriko decides to make her escape and encourages Raizo to join her; however he decides to stay. Branded as a traitor, Kiriko was caught and later executed in front of Raizo by their elder ninja brother Takeshi, impaling her through the heart. As a result of Kiriko's death, Raizo begins to harbor resentment and doubt towards the Ozunu. Some time later, Raizo is instructed by Lord Ozunu to complete his first assassination. Afterwards, Raizo meets the rest of his clan atop a city skyscraper in Berlin. There he is instructed by Lord Ozunu to execute another kunoichi traitor like Kiriko. He rebels against Lord Ozunu by cutting his face with a kyoketsu-shoge and engages in combat against his fellow ninja kin. Barely surviving, he falls off the roof of the skyscraper and into a river. Raizo recovers from his ordeal and begins to intervene and foil subsequent Ozunu assassination attempts, including a disguised female assassin at a laundromat.\nMeanwhile, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) has been investigating money-linked political murders and finds out that they are possibly connected to the Ozunu. She defies her superior, Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), and retrieves secret agency files to find out more about the investigation. Mika meets Raizo and convinces him to see Maslow for protection as well as to provide evidence against the Ozunu. However, Raizo is arrested by Maslow and abducted by agents from Europol for interrogation. Although feeling betrayed, Mika is assured by Maslow that he is still on her side and gives her a tracking device for emergencies. The Ozunu ninja infiltrate the Europol safehouse where Raizo is being held in an attempt to kill him and everybody inside. Mika frees Raizo and they both manage to escape, but Raizo suffers near-fatal wounds. Mika then takes him to a motel to hide. Resting in the motel, Mika implants the tracking device into Raizo, as the ninjas remain in pursuit. Unable to fend off the Ozunu, she hides outside the motel until Special Forces arrive to help her.\nBy the time they arrive, the ninjas have already kidnapped Raizo, bringing him before Lord Ozunu for prosecution. During transport back to the Ozunu, Raizo uses his ninja techniques to heal his own wounds. Europol special forces and tactical teams led by Maslow storm the secluded Ozunu retreat (nestled in the mountains) using the tracking device on Raizo. Turning the night into day by saturating the sky above with powerful flares, the military forces are able to fight the ninjas on their own terms. In the confusion, Mika frees Raizo from his bindings, where he proceeds to kill Takeshi and confront Lord Ozunu in a sword duel. Mika interferes to help, but is stabbed by Lord Ozunu. Enraged, Raizo uses a 'shadow blending' technique for the first time to distract and kill Lord Ozunu. Mika, seemingly fatally wounded, is in fact saved by a quirk of birth: her heart is actually on the opposite side of her chest. After Europol leaves, Raizo stays behind to tend to the ruins of the Ozunu retreat. He later climbs the same wall Kiriko did while trying to escape in the past, and looks out at the surrounding countryside, recognizing his freedom for the first time.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "So that they could become ninja assassins"}], "question": "Why did the Ozunu Clan train orphans?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Kiriko"}], "question": "Who was the only person that was kind to Raizo?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she ran away"}], "question": "Why was Kiriko killed?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they killed Kiriko"}], "question": "Why does Raizo began to doubt the Ozunu clan?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Into a river"}], "question": "Where does Raizo land after he falls off of the skyscraper?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mika"}], "question": "Who convinces Raizo to seek help from Maslow?", "id": "bf2e4b5bd8d06325ffe3fcee4af99b9d95ee34e4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Raizo is arrested"}], "question": "What happens to Raizo once he meets Maslow?

birth. Doctors are able to save her baby, but the woman dies of infection.\nThirty-one years later, the child has become the vampire hunter Blade. He raids a rave club owned by the vampire Deacon Frost. Police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he feeds on hematologist Karen Jenson and escapes. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend Abraham Whistler. Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight and silver. As Karen is now \"marked\" by the bite of a vampire, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city.\nMeanwhile, at a meeting of vampire elders, Frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. As Frost and his kind were not born as vampires and are therefore not pure-bloods, they are considered socially inferior. In response, Frost has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority.\nUpon returning to her apartment, Karen is attacked by a policeman, who is a \"familiar\", a human slave controlled by a vampire. Blade subdues the familiar and uses information from him to locate an archive of vampire history. Later, at the hideout, Blade injects himself with a special serum that prevents him from succumbing to his desire to drink blood, which would ultimately turn him into a vampire. However, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse.\nWhile experimenting with the anticoagulant EDTA as a possible replacement, Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected, but learns that it will not work on a human-vampire hybrid like Blade. Frost and his men attack the hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he helps Whistler commit suicide and arms himself with special syringes filled with EDTA.\nWhen Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost's penthouse, he finds that his mother is one of Frost's followers. He is subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra, the vampire blood god. Blade is drained of his blood, but Karen allows him to drink from her, triggering his vampirism. Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra. Blade kills all of Frost's minions, including his mother, and confronts him. During their fight, Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes, causing his body to explode.\nKaren offers to help Blade cure himself, but he asks her to create a new serum instead.

Don Henrique is older than Don Jamie by a year; under the system of primogeniture, Henrique is the heir to their father's estate. The late father's will gives Jamie a small income, but Henrique treats his younger brother with rudeness and condescension, breeding a hostile relationship between the two. The problem is that Henrique and his wife, Violante, have been married for a dozen years but have no children\u2014leaving Jamie as Henrique's heir.\nJamie is a member of a circle of aristocratic friends, which includes a boy named Ascanio. The boy is the son of poor parents, but is admired for his grace and nobility of character. Among Jamie's friends is Leandro, a lusty young man who is interested in the beautiful Amaranta. She is the wife of the rapacious lawyer Bartolus; the attorney keeps his wife closely watched, and Leandro has developed a scheme to seduce her. He masquerades as a wealthy law student come to take instruction from Bartolus. The go-between in this is Lopez, the local curate and the title character.\nDon Henrique, angered over Jamie's status as his heir, makes a radical move to change the situation: he files a legal suit (Bartolus is his lawyer) to have the boy Ascanio declared his heir. Henrique testifies that before he married Violante, he was engaged or \"precontracted\" to Ascanio's mother Jacinta, and that the boy is his natural son. (Like other plays of the era, The Spanish Curate exploits the legal and ethical ambiguity of the precontract, which in some interpretations was like a demi-marriage...but not quite.) After the child's birth, Henrique had second thoughts about the social gap between himself and Jacinta, and got the precontract cancelled. Jacinta can only affirm the basic truth of Henrique's testimony; and on that basis, Henrique wins his suit. Ascanio is now his legal heir, and Jamie is out.\nViolante, however, is outraged that Henrique has exposed this shameful affair and effectively thrown her infertility in her face. She bullies her husband into reversing course and driving Ascanio out of his house; Henrique offers the boy financial support, but the child returns to Jacinta and his pretended father Octavio. Violante is not satisfied with this, however; she reveals herself to be a truly ruthless person when she solicits Jamie to murder both Henrique and Ascanio and so come into his family fortune immediately.\nLeandro works his way into the trust of Bartolus, and tries to seduce Amaranta; she is tempted by him, but stands on her virtue and fidelity. When Bartolus finally becomes suspicious, Amaranta can show that she and Leandro have been in church, and not having a sexual assignation.\nThe plot comes to a head in the final act: Violante meets Jamie and his pretended accomplices for the double murder\u2014only to have her plot exposed. Henrique is shocked into penitence by the exposure of his wife's murder plot\u2014and reveals that he and Violante are not actually, fully legally, married after all. Bartolus too is cowed by his involvement in the matter, and vows to change his ways. Jamie has no problem accepting Ascanio as his nephew, now that their family relations are better ordered. Massinger ends the play with a couplet extolling the middle way in marital relations, between too much pliability in a husband (like Henrique) and too little (like Bartolus)\u2014much like the concluding couplet in Massinger's later play The Picture.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Spain"}], "question": "Where does this story take place?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A conflict between two brothers over their inheritance"}], "question": "What is this story about?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Don Henrique"}], "question": "Who is the older brother?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Don Jamie"}], "question": "Who is the younger brother?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Henrique and Ascanio"}], "question": "Violante tries to have who murdered?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Don Jamie"}], "question": "Who does Violante ask to murder Henrique and Ascanio?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ascanio"}], "question": "Who does Jamie accept as his nephew at the end of the story?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jacinta"}], "question": "What is Ascanio's mother's name?", "id": "bff116935a9696fc3351f49dd8a45a1ad9986458"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Amaranta"}], "question": "Who does Leandro try to seduce?

When Simon is caught by the head priest, he witnesses the tragic death of a girl he had taken a liking to when she accidentally falls from a balcony.\nAs an adult, Simon (Val Kilmer)\u2014now a professional thief dubbed \"The Saint\" for using the names of Catholic saints as aliases\u2014steals a valuable microchip belonging to a Russian oil company. Simon stages the burglary during a political rally held for the company's owner, Ivan Tretiak (Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija). Tretiak is a former Communist party boss and a billionaire oil and gas oligarch that is rallying support against the Russian President. Simon is caught in the act by Tretiak's son Ilya (Valery Nikolaev) but escapes with the microchip. After learning of the heist, Tretiak contacts Simon and hires him to steal a revolutionary cold fusion formula discovered by American electrochemist Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue). He wishes to acquire Emma's formula\u2014which creates clean, inexpensive energy\u2014so he can monopolize the energy market during a severe oil shortage in Russia.\nUsing the alias \"Thomas More,\" Simon poses as an Afrikaner and steals the formula after having a one night stand with Emma. Tretiak learns Emma's formula is incomplete and orders his henchmen, led by his son Ilya, to kill Simon and kidnap Emma in order to obtain the remaining information. Heartbroken, Emma reports the theft to Inspector Teal (Alun Armstrong) and Inspector Rabineau (Charlotte Cornwell) of Scotland Yard, who inform her Simon is a wanted international thief. Emma tracks down Simon to a hotel in Moscow and confronts him about the theft and his betrayal. The Russian police, loyal to Tretiak, arrest Simon and Emma. However, they manage to escape from the police van as they are being brought to Tretiak's mansion.\nAs they flee through the suburbs, Simon and Emma are helped by a prostitute and her family who shelter them in a hidden room in their home. Later, they meet \"Frankie\" (Irina Apeksimova), a fence who sells them the directions through an underground sewer system that lead to the American embassy. Simon and Emma exit the sewer tunnel only to find Ilya and his men waiting for them among a gathering of protestors outside the embassy's front gates. Emma safely makes it to the embassy for political asylum, while Simon allows himself to be caught by Ilya as a distraction. He escapes after rigging a car bomb that severely burns Ilya.\nSimon plants a listening device in Tretiak's office and learns he plans to perform a coup d'\u00e9tat by selling the cold fusion formula to Russian President Karpov to frame him for wasting billions on useless technology. Tretiak then plans to use the political fallout to install himself as President. Emma finishes the equations to complete the formula, and Simon delivers the information to Tretiak's physicist, Dr. Lev Botkin (Henry Goodman), who builds an apparatus which proves the formula works. Simon infiltrates the President's Kremlin residence and informs him of Tretiak's conspiracy just before Tretiak loyalists detain him. In front of a massive gathering in Red Square, Tretiak makes public accusations against President Karpov, but when the cold fusion reactor is successfully initiated, Tretiak is exposed as a fraud and arrested. He is also revealed to have caused the heating oil shortage in Moscow by illegally stockpiling vast amounts of heating oil underneath his mansion.\nSometime later, at a news conference at the University of Oxford, Emma presents her cold fusion formula to the world. Simon attends the conference in disguise and once again avoids being captured by Inspectors Teal and Rabineau when they spot him in the crowd. As he drives away, he listens to a news radio broadcast (voiced by Roger Moore) reporting that $3 billion was recently donated to the Red Cross, Salvation Army and the United Nations Children's Fund. It is implied that Simon, who had access to Tretiak's accounts, donated the money anonymously. Furthermore, a non-profit foundation led by Dr. Botkin is being established to develop the cold fusion technology.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tretiak's son"}], "question": "Who is Ilya?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "John Rossi"}], "question": "What is Simon Templar's real name?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tretiak"}], "question": "Who were the Russian police loyal to?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Russian President Karpov"}], "question": "Against whom was Tretiak plan a coup d'etat?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Creates clean and inexpensive energy"}], "question": "What does the cold fusion formula do?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A prostitute and her family"}], "question": "When fleeing the suburbs who helped Simon and Emma?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A car bomb"}], "question": "How did Ilya get severely burned?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "President Karpov"}], "question": "In this story, who is the current president of Russia?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ilya and his men"}], "question": "When Simon and Emma exited the tunnel at the American Embassy, who was waiting for them?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rebellious"}], "question": "What kind of boy was Simon at the St. Ignatius Orphanage?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He uses the names of Catholic saints as aliases during his robberies."}], "question": "How does Simon acquire the nickname \"The Saint\"?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A microchip."}], "question": "What does Simon steal from Ivan Tretiak?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A cold fusion formula for clean energy."}], "question": "What does Treitak hire Simon to steal?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The formula is incomplete and useless."}], "question": "Why does Treitak want to kill Simon and kidnap Emma after receiving the formula?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A prostitute and her family."}], "question": "Who helps Simon and Emma after they escape from police custody?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By reaching the US embassy."}], "question": "How do Simon and Emma plan on escaping from Russia?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Using it to frame the current Russian president for wasting billions of dollars."}], "question": "What does Treitak plan on doing with the incomplete formula?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They successfully built the fusion reactor proving that Treitak was trying to mislead the people of Russia."}], "question": "What happened as a result of Emma giving the completed formula to Treitak's scientists?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By stealing oil and hiding it underneath his mansion."}], "question": "How did Treitak cause an oil shortage in Moscow?", "id": "c085c72c78f6ad35854654d222a54b016b08dc65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Donated it to several charities.

With Saruman defeated, Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palant\u00edr. Overcome by curiosity, Pippin steals a glance into the seeing-stone, and suffers a mental attack from Sauron himself. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith, so he rides there to warn them, taking Pippin with him because Sauron thinks Pippin is the ring bearer.\nMeanwhile, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are led by Gollum to Minas Morgul where they witness the Witch-king of Angmar leading an Orc army to drive Denethor's younger son Faramir and his men from Osgiliath. At Gollum's urging, the three begin climbing a precarious stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way'. But having overheard Gollum's plot to regain the Ring, Sam keeps a suspicious eye on him. In Gondor, Pippin follows Gandalf's instructions and secretly lights the beacon to signal Th\u00e9oden to assemble the Rohirrim and come to Gondor's aid.\nWhile helping Th\u00e9oden gather his forces, Aragorn is approached by Elrond who says Arwen is dying. After seeing a vision of her son she refused to leave Middle Earth. Elrond then gives Aragorn the sword And\u00faril, Isildur's sword Narsil reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the Dead Men of Dunharrow. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the Paths of the Dead, recruiting the Army of the Dead with the promise to release them from their curse once they fulfil their oath to Isildur.\nFaramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath, and believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to command the city defences against the Orc army led by Gothmog. But as Gothmog's forces eventually force their way into the city, Denethor tries to kill himself and Faramir on a pyre. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Th\u00e9oden and the Rohirrim arrive. Initially the Rohirrim have the advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but are eventually overwhelmed by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim while the Witch-king mortally wounds Th\u00e9oden. Though Th\u00e9oden's niece \u00c9owyn, having posed as a male soldier, battles and slays the Witch-King with Merry's help, Th\u00e9oden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, they overcome the Orcs and win the battle. The Dead are released from their curse, and the wounded are tended to. In the Houses of Healing \u00c9owyn meets Faramir, and they comfort each other. Aragorn and the other captains of Men decide to lead all who can march upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to Mount Doom.\nMeanwhile, Gollum manipulates Frodo into leaving Sam behind before they arrive at the tunnel leading to Mordor, and then tricks him into lair of the giant spider Shelob, who paralyses and binds Frodo. Sam arrives and drives Shelob away, but believing his friend to be dead takes Frodo's sword Sting and The One Ring for safekeeping. When he sees Frodo's body being taken by Orcs to Cirith Ungol he realises that Frodo is still alive, and gives chase. Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs, and returns the Ring to him.\nAragorn's army draw out Sauron's forces and empty Mordor, allowing the exhausted Hobbits to stagger to the volcano, but they're attacked by Gollum when they reach Mount Doom. Frodo finally succumbs to the Ring's power and claims it as his own, and refuses to destroy it. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring, but Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum (while holding the Ring) into the volcano where the Ring was made. Sam manages to save Frodo. The Ring and Sauron are both destroyed, causing a chain-reaction that consumes the mountain, topples Barad-d\u00fbr, and kills most of the fleeing Orcs as the ground crumbles beneath them. Gandalf flies in with eagles to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members.\nAragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. They, and all others present at his coronation, bow before Frodo and the Hobbits. The Hobbits then return to the Shire where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Frodo, unable to cope with the traumas of his journey, departs Middle Earth for the Grey Havens with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves, leaving Sam the Red Book of Westmarch which details their adventures. Though saddened by Frodo's departure, Sam is gladdened by the warm welcome he receives upon returning home.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pippin"}], "question": "Who looked into

community named Argo City, in a pocket of trans-dimensional space. A man named Zaltar allows Kara to see a unique and immensely powerful item known as the Omegahedron, which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city government, and which powers the city. However, after a mishap, the Omegahedron is blown out into space. Much to the distress of her parents, Kara follows it to Earth (undergoing a transformation into \"Supergirl\" in the process) in an effort to recover it and save the city.\nOn Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena, a power-hungry would-be witch assisted by the feckless Bianca, seeking to free herself from her relationship with warlock Nigel. Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes that the Omegahedron is powerful and can enable her to perform real magical spells. Supergirl arrives on Earth and discovers her powers. Following the path of the Omegahedron, she takes the name Linda Lee, identifies herself as the cousin of Clark Kent, and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane, the younger sister of Lois Lane who happens to be studying there. Supergirl also meets and becomes enamoured with Ethan, who works as a groundskeeper at the school.\nEthan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion (which will make him fall in love with the first person he sees for a day); however, Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle which she sends to bring Ethan back, causing chaos in the streets as it does so. Supergirl rescues Ethan and he falls in love with her instead while in the guise of Linda Lee.\nSupergirl and Selena repeatedly battle in various ways, until Selena uses her powers to put Supergirl in an \"eternal void\" known as the Phantom Zone. Here, stripped of her powers, she wanders the bleak landscape and nearly drowns in an oily bog. Yet she finds help in Zaltar, who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron. Zaltar sacrifices his life to allow Supergirl to escape. Back on Earth, Selena misuses the Omegahedron to make herself a \"princess of Earth\", with Ethan as her lover and consort. Emerging from the Phantom Zone through a mirror, Supergirl regains her powers and confronts Selena, who uses the Omegahedron's power to summon a gigantic shadow demon. The demon overwhelms Supergirl and is on the verge of defeating her when she hears Zaltar's voice urging her to fight on. Supergirl breaks free and is told by Nigel the only way to defeat Selena is to turn the shadow demon against her. Supergirl quickly complies and begins flying in circles around her, trapping her in a whirlwind. Selena is attacked and incapacitated by the monster as the whirlwind pulls Bianca in as well. The three of them are sucked back into the mirror portal, which promptly reforms, trapping them all within forever. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda and that he knows that she and Supergirl are one and the same, but knows it is possible he may never see her again and understands she must save Argo City. The final scene shows Kara returning the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which promptly lights up again.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Earth."}], "question": "Where does the Omegahedron land after it is blown out into space?", "id": "c1f66dca3c206bc1998f6270427ad00da6c781c2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Selena assisted by Bianca."}], "question": "Who recovers the Omegahedron on Earth?", "id": "c1f66dca3c206bc1998f6270427ad00da6c781c2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It allows Selena to perform real magical spells."}], "question": "What does the Omegahedron allow Selena to do?", "id": "c1f66dca3c206bc1998f6270427ad00da6c781c2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Linda Lee."}], "question": "What name does Kara Zor-El take on Earth?

Everyone has changed. As a joke, Rose lines up her seven cousins to take a long look at them, just as they did with her when they first met. The youngest, Jamie, accidentally mentions that the aunts want Rose to marry one of her cousins to keep her fortune in the family. Rose is very indignant, for she has decided ideas about what her future holds. From the beginning, she declares that she can manage her property well on her own and that she will focus on philanthropic work. Charlie has already decided she is marked out for him, with the approval of his mother.\nPhebe also comes home no longer the servant that Rose \"adopted\" but as a young lady with a cultured singing ability. Rose challenges anyone who would look down on \"her Phebe\", and she is readily accepted as part of the Campbell clan until Archie falls in love with her: the family feel that Archie would be marrying beneath himself. Phebe's pride and debt to the family make her wish to prove herself before she will accept Archie; so she leaves the Campbells' home and sets off to make a name for herself as a singer, to try to earn the respect of her adopted family.\nAfter some time at home, Rose has her \"coming out\" into society, much to her Uncle Alec's chagrin. She promises to try high society for only three months. During that time, her cousin Charlie falls in love with her and tries in various ways to woo her. Rose begins to give in to his charm, but he derails the budding romance by coming to her house, late one night, very drunk. This ruins all her respect for him and she sees how unprincipled he really is. After the three months are up, Rose begins to focus on her philanthropic projects and convinces Charlie to try to refrain from alcohol and other frivolous things, in order to win her love and respect.\nShe tries to help Charlie overcome his bad habits with the help of her uncle, but fails. Charlie does all he can to win her heart, but in the end he succumbs, hindered by his own weak will and his constant need for acceptance by his friends. Being spoilt by his mother meant he never learned to say \"no\", even to himself, and his lack of discipline proves fatal: Charlie's life ends tragically in an alcohol-induced accident on the eve of his voyage to see his father and restore his good character. Although Rose never was in love with Charlie, she did have hope that he would return a better man and that they might see what relationship could develop.\nSeveral months after Charlie's death, Rose finds out that another cousin, Mac, is now in love with her. At first, never thought of him as anything but \"the worm\", she refuses his love; but she does declare the deepest respect for him. This gives Mac hope, and he goes to medical school, willing to work and wait for her. She finds his devotion touching, and she begins to see him clearly for the first time, realizing that Mac is the \"hero\" she has been looking for. He is exactly suited to her tastes and has become a man in the noblest sense of the word. He also settles a joke with her by publishing a small book of poetry to wide critical success, earning her respect even more deeply. It is his absence that shows her how much she cares for him.\nWhile Rose is discovering her heart, Steve and a minor character, Kitty, engage to marry. This creates a new sensation in the family, and Kitty begins to look to Rose for sisterly guidance. Rose encourages her to improve her silly mind, and Kitty is a very willing pupil. Rose continues to wait for Mac's return but reaches a crisis when Uncle Alec becomes very sick while visiting Mac; Phebe nurses him back from the brink of death, at personal peril, and returns him to the anxious Campbells to be greeted as a triumphant member of the family, sealing her own engagement with Archie with everyone's blessing. This homecoming is completed for Rose when she is reunited with Mac and finally declares her own sentiments. The book closes with three very happy couples, and much hope for their felicity.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Her aunts"}], "question": "Who wanted Rose to marry one of her

hedge fund with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. One night, while driving with his mistress Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed. An injured Robert leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.\nRobert calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Robert's driver for many years. After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.\nJimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Robert finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. Robert's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth. When Robert refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding but will tell them that he was there all night if he agrees to sign.\nIn the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It was proven that Bryer had

A traveler and amateur naturalist, he regains consciousness \"under a heap of earth and stones\" and believes that he had been knocked unconscious in a fall\u00a0\u2013 though his thoughts and recollections are confused. He is astounded to discover that he is entwined in the roots of plants, as though they have been growing around him. Extricating himself and surveying the scene, he sees a great house in the distance, and walks toward it to seek help and information. On his way, he encounters a funeral: a group of strangely yet strikingly dressed people, led by a majestic white-bearded old man, are interring a corpse in a grave. The narrator is especially struck by a beautiful girl who is overcome by grief. She appears to be about 14 years old; though, he soon learns that this world, and everyone in it are far older than they appear. He becomes enchanted by her, and falls in love. The funeral party see him, and express surprise at his presence and his odd uncouth clothes and boots; but they allow him to accompany them to the enormous mansion where they live.\nEnthralled with the girl (her name is Yoletta), and anxious to show his worth in their House, the narrator agrees to work for a year as a probationer in this community. He is constantly stumbling into misunderstandings with his new companions, for the world seems to have changed in so many extreme and incomprehensible ways. The most basic concepts of his society are unknown to these people. When he inquires about the nearest city, the old man who is \"the Father of the House\" thinks he is talking about a beehive. When the narrator notes that they share the English language, he is again not understood; the people of the house think they speak \"the language of human beings\u00a0\u2013 that is all.\" (Though their spoken language has changed little, the writing system is altered so much that the narrator cannot read the \"Hebrew-like characters\" in which their books are written.) It seems that the entire human race is now organized into communal houses like this one, with no other form of social structure, that they know of.\nThe narrator struggles to adapt to this new society, as he pursues Yoletta. He is shocked to learn that all the people are much older than they appear; Yoletta is 31 years old, and the Father of the House is nearly 200. They are vegetarians, and have a strong rapport with the animals in their environment. The narrator is struck by their \"rare physical beauty,\" their \"crystal purity of heart,\" \"ever contented and calmly glad\". Yet he wonders why they have no romantic interests, and why there are no children in the community. He sometimes falls afoul of the strict rules, in which lying is a serious offense, punishable by solitary confinement. Yoletta comes to love him, but like a brother, without the heat of passion he feels for her.\nIn time he meets the mysterious Mother of the House, and begins to comprehend the full strangeness and differentness of their way of life. The humans of this distant future have achieved their utopian state by abandoning sexuality and romantic love. Like a beehive, or a wolf pack, only the Queen, or Alpha Male and Female, or Father and Mother of the House, in this case, reproduce. The rest of the House live communally, as siblings. The narrator despairs when he realizes that his passion for Yoletta can never be consummated; and, wonders whether he can adapt to this mode of living. He does not realize that the Mother has begun the long process of grooming himself and Yoletta to become the new Father and Mother of the House.\nWhen he is in the library, he discovers an elaborately-carved bottle on a shelf; its inscription states that its contents provide a cure for the oppressions of \"time and disease\" and the thoughts or passions that \"lead to madness.\" He takes a dose of the liquid, thinking it will cure his passion for Yoletta, which he doesn't realize she has begun to learn to reciprocate. It is only when his body grows stiff and cold that he realizes that the potion is a poison, and that the only relief from the pains of life it provides is death.\nThis story, of a traveler who falls in love with a mysterious, beautiful young girl with an elderly protector, anticipates the plot of Hudson's later and more famous novel, Green Mansions.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A funeral"}], "question": "What does Smith run into when he regains consciousness?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "14 years old"}], "question": "That girl that Smith falls in love with looks how old?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A probationer"}], "question": "What job does Smith take in the community?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The language of human beings"}], "question": "According to the people of the house, what language do they speak?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is 31 years old"}], "question": "How old is Yoletta acutally?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Solitary confinement"}], "question": "Lying in this community can get you what type of penalty?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The alpha male and the queen of the house"}], "question": "Who is allowed to reproduce in this community?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Father and Mother of the house"}], "question": "What is another term used for the Alpha male and Queen of the House?", "id": "c3ad97ba978bd2f56484be04acb706a6a42d8e00"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A bottle of poison"}], "question": "Trying to cure his passion for Yoletta, what does Smith drink?

The decline of the Ambersons is contrasted with the rising fortunes of industrial tycoons and other new-money families, who derived power not from family names but by \"doing things\". As George Amberson's friend (name unspecified) says, \"don't you think being things is 'rahthuh bettuh' than doing things?\"\nThe titular family is the most prosperous and powerful in town at the turn of the century. Young George Amberson Minafer, the patriarch's grandson, is spoiled terribly by his mother Isabel. Growing up arrogant, sure of his own worth and position, and totally oblivious to the lives of others, George falls in love with Lucy Morgan, a young though sensible debutante. But there is a long history between George's mother and Lucy's father, of which George is unaware. As the town grows into a city, industry thrives, the Ambersons' prestige and wealth wanes, and the Morgans, thanks to Lucy's prescient father, grow prosperous.

The head of mall security, Ronald \"Ronnie\" Barnhardt (Rogen), makes it his mission to apprehend the offender. He is assisted by Charles, Dennis, and the Yuen twins (John and Matthew Yuan), in his efforts.\nThe next day, Ronnie's dream girl, Brandi (Faris), who works a mall make-up counter, encounters the flasher. Ronnie tries to comfort her until a police officer, Detective Harrison, arrives and takes over Ronnie's palliative role. Ronnie is upset that his boss allowed an outsider to infringe on his search for the offender.\nThe criminal activity at the mall continues, as a masked person is seen robbing a shoe store, causing property damage. Detective Harrison is once again called in to investigate, his efforts hindered by Ronnie, who thinks that Saddamn, an Arab shopkeeper in the mall is the thief, based on the fact that he is an Arab. Ronnie curses Saddamn out, and Harrison profanely excoriates Ronnie for this during a meeting with Ronnie's superior, and in response, Ronnie decides to take steps to become a police officer.\nAs part of his preparations, Ronnie decides to ride along with Detective Harrison. Harrison, fed up with Ronnie, tricks him into walking into the most dangerous part of town, and drives off. Ronnie then confronts and subsequently assaults several drug dealers, victoriously returning to the police station with a dealer's son and thanking the detective for the opportunity to prove himself. Emboldened, Ronnie arranges a date with Brandi. On their date, Brandi sees Ronnie taking a prescription clonazepam, and thinking that Ronnie takes them recreationally, she asks him for the bottle. She consumes multiple tablets herself while drinking. Ronnie takes her home and rapes her while she is apparently semi-conscious, and at one point, when he stops mid-coitus, she says groggily, \"Why are you stopping, motherfucker?\", compelling him to continue.\nRonnie passes the background check and physical examination for the police officer job, but fails the psychological examination. Nell, a friendly food court worker, explains to him that her boss, Roger and Trina, another female employee make fun of Nell for having her leg in a cast. Ronnie then beats up Roger and warns him and Trina not to harass Nell again. Depressed, he is persuaded by Dennis to spend the day doing a wide variety of drugs and assaulting skateboarding teenagers. At the end of the day, Ronnie finds out that Dennis was the shoe thief, and that he has been stealing from the mall for some time. Ronnie is stunned and, after a brief argument, is knocked unconscious by Dennis, who then flees to Mexico.\nRonnie decides to go undercover in order to catch the flasher. At night he sees Harrison having sex with Brandi, and he confronts her in front of onlookers at the mall the next day, blowing his cover and inadvertently destroying a display case. When the police are summoned, Ronnie fights them and Harrison. Ronnie loses the fight and is arrested.\nAfter a night in jail, Ronnie's mom gives him a postcard from Dennis in Mexico. Dennis admits that he respects Ronnie for caring so much. The next day, Ronnie returns to the mall, fired from his job. Despondent, he sits at a food court table, where Nell, whose cast has been removed, and is sporting a more flattering hairdo, brings him a complimentary cup of coffee. As a vulnerable Ronnie expresses his sadness over his situation, Nell kisses him. Interrupting their romantic moment, the flasher exposes himself to Nell and Ronnie and runs off, exposing himself to many other mall patrons. Ronnie, pursuing the flasher in a slow-motion sequence that includes him punching Saddamn in the face, retrieves a gun and shoots the flasher in the shoulder as he charges toward Brandi. Refusing the flasher an ambulance, Ronnie brings the flasher to his feet to take him to the police station, and as he does so, his boss, Mark rehires him.

Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles, his activity inadvertently causes millions of dollars in property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he is routinely jeered at the crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas from the city of Los Angeles to address the property damage he has caused.\nWhen public relations spokesperson Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life, but he causes the train to derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage, but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image, and Hancock grudgingly accepts. The spokesperson convinces the alcoholic superhero to permit himself to be jailed for outstanding subpoenas so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock. When the crime rate rises after Hancock's incarceration, the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police. Reluctantly donning a new costume (which has been provided by Ray), Hancock foils a bank robbery, aiding a wounded officer and stops the leader of the robbers, Red Parker (Eddie Marsan) from detonating explosive-laden vests attached to the bank hostages.\nAfter the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his handling of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular once more, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron), with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family, but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is also apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins, and she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary lies and claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful, and he departs to tell Ray about her. The exchange results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home just in time to see Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.\nLater that night, Hancock is shot twice in the chest and wounded when he stops a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and explains that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her powers. He make several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. As gratitude to Ray, Hancock paints Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to the worldwide advertisement.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Hancock, now living in New York City, confronts a fleeing criminal with the police. Cornered, the man takes a hostage and jeeringly demands Hancock escort him to safety. Hancock turns back and smiles as the credits resume.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he is always intoxicated, Hancock accidently causes millions of dollars worth of property damange."}], "question": "Whaat happens each time John Hancock uses his super powers to stop criminals?", "id": "c5260ebf086da66320320ca1bd1c15a456610b17"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Los Angeles."}], "question": "Which city sends court subpoenas to Hancock asking that he address the property damages he causes?

During the reign of Domitian, Agricola, a faithful imperial general, had been the most important general involved in the conquest of a great part of Britain. The proud tone of the Agricola recalls the style of the laudationes funebres (funeral speeches). A quick r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the career of Agricola prior to his mission in Britain is followed by a narration of the conquest of the island. There is a geographical and ethnological digression, taken not only from notes and memories of Agricola but also from the De Bello Gallico of Julius Caesar. The content is so varied as to go beyond the limits of a simple biography, but the narration, whatever its form, serves to exalt the subject of the biography.\nTacitus exalts the character of his father-in-law, by showing how \u2014 as governor of Roman Britain and commander of the army \u2014 he attends to matters of state with fidelity, honesty, and competence, even under the government of the hated Emperor Domitian. Critiques of Domitian and of his regime of spying and repression come to the fore at the work's conclusion. Agricola remained uncorrupted; in disgrace under Domitian, he died without seeking the glory of an ostentatious martyrdom. Tacitus condemns the suicide of the Stoics as of no benefit to the state. Tacitus makes no clear statement as to whether the death of Agricola was from natural causes or ordered by Domitian, although he does say that rumors were voiced in Rome that Agricola was poisoned on

Sir Howard Hallam, a judge, and his sister-in-law, Lady Cicely Waynflete, a well-known explorer, are at the home of Rankin, a Presbyterian minister. Rankin, knows Sir Howard as the brother of an old friend, Miles Hallam, who moved to Brazil after marrying a local woman. Sir Howard tells Rankin that his brother's property was illicitly seized after his death by his widow's family, but Sir Howard has now recovered it. Lady Cicely decides to explore Morocco with Sir Howard. They are advised to take an armed escort. This can be organised by Captain Brassbound, a smuggler who owns a ship called Thanksgiving. When Brassbound arrives, he warns Sir Howard that in the mountain-country justice is ruled by codes of honour, not law courts.\nACT II, A Moorish castle occupied by Brassbound. Marzo, an Italian member of Brassbound's crew, has been wounded in a feud. Lady Cicely is tending to him, initially to Brassbound's irritation, but she wins him over. Sir Howard complains that Brassbound is behaving more like a jailer than a host; Brassbound says that Sir Howard is his prisoner. Brassbound explains that he is the son of Sir Howard's deceased brother, Miles. He blames Sir Howard for the death of his mother and for tricking him out of his inheritance by legal technicalities. He intends to hand over Sir Howard to a fanatical Islamist Sheik. He tells Sir Howard that he presides over an unfair justice system that punishes the poor and weak. Now that Sir Howard is powerless he will receive the justice of revenge. Lady Cicely intercedes and argues with Brassbound that his own code of honour is at least as brutal as the legal system he condemns. Brassbound wavers, and eventually agrees to give up revenge. When the Sheik arrives he offers to buy back Sir Howard, but the Shiek will only accept one price \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lady Cicely. Cicely agrees, but at this point the local ruler appears, having learned of the transaction. He frees Sir Howard and arrests Brassbound.\nACT III, Rankin's house. Commander Kearney is to preside over a court of inquiry into Brassbound's actions. Sir Howard says he cannot interfere, but Lady Cicely persuades him to let her tell the court all that happened on the trip. She uses all her powers of persuasion to convince Commander Kearney that Brassbound is innocent of any crime. Kearney agrees to release Brassbound. The liberated Brassbound declares his devotion to Lady Cicely, and says he wishes to marry her. Lady Cicely is powerfully drawn to Brassbound, and fears that she may succumb to his charisma. As she is about to agree, a gunshot is heard. It is the signal from Brassbound's crew that his ship is ready to depart. He leaves immediately, leaving Lady Cicely to say \"What an escape!\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mogador, Morocco"}], "question": "Where does this story take place?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Captain Brassbound"}], "question": "Who owns the Thanksgiving?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Captain Brassbound"}], "question": "Who is the armed escort hired by Sir Howard and Lady Cicely?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His father is Sir Howard's brother, Miles, so Brasshound is Howard's nephew"}], "question": "How is Brassbound related to Sir Howard?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brassbound blames Howard for the death of his mother and being tricked out of his inheritance"}], "question": "Why does Brassbound dislike Sir Howard?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Cicely"}], "question": "What is the price for the Shiek taking Sir Howard?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Cicely"}], "question": "Who wants to talk to the Court about everything that happened on the trip?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To try to free him"}], "question": "Why does Lady Cicely want to talk to the court about Brassbound's actions?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because she saved him from being punished"}], "question": "Why does Brassbound declare he wants to marry Lady Cicely?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A gunshot"}], "question": "What is the sound that alerts Brassbound that it's time for him to go?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Morocco"}], "question": "What country does the story take place?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Cicely Waynflete"}], "question": "Which character is know as a explorer?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rankin"}], "question": "What is the ministers name?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Thanksgiving"}], "question": "What is the smugglers ship called?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brassbound"}], "question": "Who is occupying a Moorish castle?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marzo"}], "question": "Which character is an Italian member of Brassbound's crew?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sir Howard"}], "question": "Who does Brassbound say is his prisoner?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brassbound"}], "question": "Who is the son of Sir Howards brother Miles?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady Cicely"}], "question": "Who tells the court what happened on the trip?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "judge"}], "question": "What is Howard Hallams profession?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sir"}], "question": "What is Howard's title?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "explorer"}], "question": "What is Cicely Waynflete's profession?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lady"}], "question": "What is Cicely's title?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "minister"}], "question": "What is Rankin's profession?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Presbyterian"}], "question": "What is the denomination of Rankin's church?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brazil"}], "question": "Where does Miles Hallam move after marrying?", "id": "c9fab7d896ddf088d12ac7aaa448960789c73850"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Morocco"}], "question": "Where do Cicely and Howard decide to explore?

The house of the title is a gloomy New England mansion, haunted since its construction by fraudulent dealings, accusations of witchcraft, and sudden death. The current resident, the dignified but desperately poor Hepzibah Pyncheon, opens a shop in a side room to support her brother Clifford, who has completed a thirty-year sentence for murder. She refuses all assistance from her wealthy but unpleasant cousin, Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon. A distant relative, the lively and pretty young Phoebe, arrives and quickly becomes invaluable, charming customers and rousing Clifford from depression. A delicate romance grows between Phoebe and the mysterious attic lodger Holgrave, who is writing a history of the Pyncheon family.\nThe house was built on ground wrongfully seized from its rightful owner, Matthew Maule, by Colonel Pyncheon, the founder of the Massachusetts branch of the family. Maule was accused of practicing witchcraft and was executed. According to legend, at his death Maule laid a curse upon the Pyncheon family. During the housewarming festivities, Colonel Pyncheon was found dead in his armchair; whether he actually died from the curse or from a congenital disease is unclear. His portrait remains in the house as a symbol of its dark past and the weight of the curse upon the spirit of its inhabitants.\nPhoebe arranges to visit her country home, but plans to return soon. Clifford, depressed by his isolation from humanity and his lost youth spent in prison, stands at a large arched window above the stairs and has a sudden urge to jump. The departure of Phoebe, the focus of his attention, leaves him bed-ridden.\nJudge Pyncheon arrives to find information about land in Maine, rumored to belong to the family. He threatens Clifford with an insanity hearing unless he reveals details about the land or the location of the missing deed. Clifford is unable to comply. Before Clifford can be brought before the Judge (which would destroy Clifford's fragile psyche), the Judge mysteriously dies while sitting in Colonel Pyncheon's chair. Hepzibah and Clifford flee by train. The next day, Phoebe returns and finds that Holgrave has discovered the Judge's body. The townsfolk begin to gossip about Hepzibah and Clifford's sudden disappearance. Phoebe is relieved when Hepzibah and Clifford return, having recovered their wits.\nNew evidence in the crime that sent Clifford to prison proves his innocence. He was framed for the death of his uncle by Jaffrey, who was even then looking for the missing deed. Holgrave is revealed as Maule's descendant, but he bears no ill will toward the Pyncheons. The missing deed is discovered behind the old Colonel's portrait, but the paper is worthless: the land is already settled by others. The characters abandon the old house and start a new life in the countryside, free from the burdens of the past.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hepzibah Pyncheon."}], "question": "Who owned the House Of Seven Gables in the Mid Nintenth century?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Witchcraft and Sudden Death."}], "question": "What rumors surrounded the houses past?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "30 years."}], "question": "How long did Clifford serve time for man slaughter ?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Matthew Maule."}], "question": "Who originally owned the house?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He put a curse on the Pyncheon."}], "question": "What did Matthew do as he died?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Colonel Pyncheon."}], "question": "Whos picture hangs on the wall to this day?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The missing deed to land."}], "question": "What is Judge Pyncheon looking for?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sitting in the Colonels chair."}], "question": "How does the Judge die?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jaffrey."}], "question": "Who actually killed Cliffords uncle?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Behind the portrait of the Colonel."}], "question": "Where is the missing deed found?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Late 17th century."}], "question": "In what century was the house built?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Hepzibah Pyncheon."}], "question": "Who was the current resident of the house?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pyncheon's brother Clifford."}], "question": "Who completed 30 years for murder?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Practicing witchcraft."}], "question": "Why was Maule executed?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pyncheon family."}], "question": "Who did Maule laid a curse on?", "id": "caf8d1c02839b265efafa097df884f48f1b430e1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was isolation from humanity and lost his youth in prison.

The lady, Anna Sergeyevna, is also vacationing, while her husband remains at home in an unnamed provincial town.

John and Alice (Rutherford) Clayton II, Lord and Lady Greystoke of England, are marooned in the western coastal jungles of equatorial Africa in 1888. In September 1889 their son John Clayton III is born. At one year old his mother dies, and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape Kerchak. The infant is then adopted by the she-ape Kala.\nClayton is named \"Tarzan\" (\"White Skin\" in the ape language) and raised in ignorance of his human heritage.\nAs a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, he discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.\nUpon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla which he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as \"king\" of the apes.\nLater, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of its hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them. They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.\nAt about the age of 20 a new party is marooned on the coast, including Jane Porter, the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Tarzan's cousin, William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party. Tarzan spies on the newcomers, aids them in secret, and saves Jane from the perils of the jungle.\nAmong the party was French Naval Officer Paul D'Arnot. While rescuing D'Arnot from the natives, a rescue ship recovers the castaways. D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak French and offers to take Tarzan to the land of white men where he might connect with Jane again. On their journey, D'Arnot teaches him how to behave among white men. In the ensuing months, Tarzan eventually learns to speak English as well.\nUltimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in Wisconsin, USA. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton the Earl of Greystoke. Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

from the dread which they entertained of the power of the deities, from terror of their wrath. This wrath was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a future state (or, where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death). To remove these fears, and thus to establish tranquility in the heart, was the purpose of his teaching. Thus the deities, whose existence he did not deny, lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peace, strangers to all the passions, desires, and fears, which agitate the human heart, totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes.\nTo prove this position he called upon the atomism of Democritus, so as to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a Supreme Being, but by the mixing of elemental particles that had existed from all eternity governed by certain simple laws. Lucretius' task was to clearly state and fully develop these views in an attractive form; his work was an attempt to show that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws, without the need for the intervention of divine beings.\nLucretius identifies the supernatural with the notion that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena. These phenomena are the regular, but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny atoms in empty space. Meanwhile, he argues against the fear of death by stating that death is the dissipation of a being's material mind. Lucretius uses the analogy of a vessel, stating that the physical body is the vessel that holds both the mind (mens) and spirit (anima) of a human being. Neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body. Thus Lucretius states that once the vessel (the body) shatters (dies) its contents (mind and spirit) can no longer exist. So, as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being. Being completely devoid of sensation and thought, a dead person cannot miss being alive. According to Lucretius, fear of death is a projection of terrors experienced in life, of pain that only a living (intact) mind can feel. Lucretius also puts forward the 'symmetry argument' against the fear of death. In it, he says that people who fear the prospect of eternal non-existence after death should think back to the eternity of non-existence before their birth, which probably did not cause them much suffering.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "From the dread and fear of entertaining the gods' powers and anger."}], "question": "According to Epicurus, humans' unhappiness and degradation arose largely from what?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To remove the peoples' fear of the gods' wrath."}], "question": "What was the purpose of Epicurus' teaching?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The atomism of Democritus."}], "question": "What did Epicurus call upon to demonstrate that a Supreme Being did not create the universe?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That the universe was formed by the mixing of eternally-existing particles."}], "question": "What does the atomism of Democritus try to explain?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To clearly state and fully develop Epicurus' views in an attractive way."}], "question": "What was Lucretius' task?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Divine intervention."}], "question": "What was not needed to explain how everything in nature works?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Natural phenomena."}], "question": "The way the world operated can be accounted for in terms of what?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "One's material mind dissipating."}], "question": "What is death according to Lucretius?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The analogy of a vessel."}], "question": "What analogy did Lucretius use to explain death?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The symmetry argument."}], "question": "What argument explained about eternal non-existence before birth and after death?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Democritus"}], "question": "Who did Epicurus call upon to prove the position?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Epicurus"}], "question": "Who wanted to demonstrate the world was not formed by a supreme being?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Wrath"}], "question": "What is displayed by the misfortunes in life?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lucretius"}], "question": "Who identifies that the deities created our world?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Lucretius"}], "question": "Who uses the analogy that the body is a vessel?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The body and mind"}], "question": "What is it that vessel is supposed to hold?", "id": "cba4515370099009b03d469ebe3e8ab69550bd2d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The mind"}], "question": "What cannot survive independently without the body?

At school, Andrew is frequently bullied.\nAndrew's cousin Matt Garetty invites him to a party to help him meet people, but Andrew's filming causes an altercation with an attendee and he leaves disappointed. He is persuaded by popular student Steve Montgomery to record something strange that he and Matt have found in the woods. The trio enter a hole in the ground, where they hear a loud strange noise and discover a large glowing blue crystalline object which turns red, and gives them painful nosebleeds. As the crystalline object begins to react violently, the camera cuts out. Weeks later, Andrew, Matt, and Steve record themselves as they display telekinetic abilities, but begin bleeding from their noses when they overexert themselves. They develop a close friendship and begin using their abilities to play pranks, but when Andrew telekinetically pushes a rude motorist off the road and into a river, Matt insists that they restrict the use of their powers, particularly against living things.\nWhen they discover flight abilities, they agree to fly around the world together after graduation. Andrew wants to visit Tibet because of its peaceful nature. Steve encourages him to enter the school talent show to gain popularity. Andrew amazes his fellow students by disguising his powers as an impressive magic act. After the show, Andrew, Matt and Steve celebrate at a house party where Andrew becomes the center of attention. After drinking with his classmate Monica, she and Andrew go upstairs to have sex, but he vomits on her, humiliating themselves.\nAndrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and aggressive, culminating when his father Richard attacks him and Andrew uses his powers to overwhelm him. His outburst is so extreme that it inflicts psychically connected nosebleeds on Steve and Matt. While Matt ignores the nosebleed, Steve flies up to Andrew in the middle of a storm and tries to console him. However, Andrew grows increasingly frustrated, and Steve is suddenly struck by a lightning bolt and killed. At Steve's funeral, Matt confronts Andrew about the suspicious circumstances of Steve's death. Andrew denies responsibility to Matt, but he privately begs for forgiveness at Steve's grave.\nAndrew grows distant from Matt and again finds himself ostracized at school. After being bullied, he uses his powers to tear teeth out of a bully's mouth. Andrew begins to identify himself as an apex predator, rationalizing that he should not feel guilt for using his powers to hurt those weaker than himself. When his mother's condition deteriorates, Andrew uses his powers to steal money for her medicine. After mugging a local gang, he robs a gas station where he inadvertently causes an explosion that puts him in the hospital with significant burns, and under police investigation. At his bedside, his father informs the unconscious Andrew that his mother has died, and he angrily blames Andrew for her death. As his father is about to strike him, Andrew awakens and the wall of his hospital room explodes.\nAt a birthday party, Matt experiences a nosebleed and senses Andrew is in trouble. He and his girlfriend, Casey, go to the hospital, where Andrew is floating outside. After saving Richard when Andrew attempts to kill him, Matt confronts his cousin at the Space Needle and tries to reason with him, but Andrew grows hostile and irrational at any perceived attempt to control him. Andrew attacks Matt and the pair fight across the city, crashing through buildings and hurling vehicles. Enraged and fully insane, albeit heavily injured, Andrew uses his powers to destroy the buildings around him, threatening hundreds of lives. Unable to get through to Andrew and left with no other choice, Matt telekinetically impales Andrew with a spear from a nearby statue. The police surround Matt, but he flies away.\nLater, Matt lands in Tibet with Andrew's camera. Speaking to the camera while addressing Andrew, Matt tearfully vows to use his powers for good and to find out what happened to them in the hole. He positions the camera to view a Tibetan monastery in the distance before flying away, leaving the camera behind.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seattle, Washington."}], "question": "Where does the story take place?", "id": "cc49ee763ad73ea914a925f7dddf3687b77a69c9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His counsin, Matt Garetty."}], "question": "Who invites Andrew to a party to meet people?", "id": "cc49ee763ad73ea914a925f7dddf3687b77a69c9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Matt and Steve."}], "question": "Who does Andrew discover the blue crystalline with?

Charley's old best friend, Edward \"Evil Ed\" Lee, informs him that many students have gone missing, including their other childhood friend, Adam Johnson. When Charley goes home after school, his mother, Jane, introduces him to Jerry Dandrige, their new neighbor. Fed-up and angry with Ed after he claims that Jerry is a vampire, Charley tells him that he's crazy and that he doesn't want to be friends anymore.\nOn his way home, Ed is confronted by Jerry, who claims that he has been watching Ed and has been aware of Ed watching him. Jerry soon chases Ed into a nearby pool and convinces him into believing that his life would be much better if he was a vampire. Ed succumbs and willingly allows Jerry to bite him. The next day, Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to investigate, starting to believe Ed's claims when he discovers video recordings of objects moving on their own, with Ed's voiceover revealing that he is recording Jerry to prove that his reflection doesn't show up in recordings. As Jerry begins to attack more people throughout the neighborhood, Charley sneaks into Jerry's house and finds out that he keeps his victims in secret rooms. Charley goes to Las Vegas magician Peter Vincent, a supposed expert on vampires. Peter doesn't take him seriously, and kicks him out.\nJerry comes to Charley's house and sets fire to it. Charley, Jane, and his girlfriend, Amy Peterson, flee through the desert in their minivan. Jerry catches up with them, but is wounded by Jane with a real estate sign stake. Jane is admitted to a hospital, where Charley is summoned by Peter. Upon arriving at Peter's penthouse Ed turns up. By now Ed has been fully transformed into a vampire and he aids Jerry in attacking Charley, Amy, and Peter. As they fight, Ed lets all of his anger out on his opponent and Charley reluctantly kills Ed. Meanwhile, Amy injures Jerry with holy water. They then run into a club, where they get separated in the crowd. Amy is kissed, bitten, and possessed by Jerry, who proceeds to take her.\nPeter refuses to help Charley and reveals that both of his parents were killed by a vampire (later revealed to be Jerry himself). He does, however, give Charley a stake blessed by Saint Michael that will kill Jerry and turn all of his victims back into humans. Charley goes to Jerry's house where Peter decides to join him after all.\nThey are led into Jerry's basement, where they are attacked by many of Jerry's victims, including Amy. Charley confronts Amy and she explains how they can be with each other forever. Just as she is about to bite Charley he stabs her, missing the heart and then escaping. Meanwhile, Peter is ambushed by Jerry and many of his victims. Peter is able to kill a few before his weapon backfires. Charley returns to the basement only to see Peter being fed on by the remaining vampires. He decides to shoot holes in the roof, from which sunlight shines in and kills them. The patch of sunlight guards both Charley and Peter from the vampires who had not been destroyed. Jerry appears, explaining that Charley's quest is in fact over. Charley, having outfitted himself in a flame-retardant suit, has Peter light him on fire and tackles Jerry just as Amy is feeding off him. A struggle between the two ensues while the other vampires watch. Peter assists him by shooting another hole in the floor above to allow sunlight in. This burns Jerry, and Peter tosses Charley the stake he had dropped.\nCharley quickly stabs Jerry in the heart, killing him and returning his victims to their human form. Afterwards, Charley's mother recovers from the hospital and goes to shop for a new house as Charley and Amy have sex in Peter's penthouse.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To shoot holes into the roof so the sunlight can kill the vampires."}], "question": "What is the gun used for?", "id": "ccfabbee5a88f09447f3cbba5ea0f86e5c039058"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Charley's old best friend, Ed.

During the first few minutes of the film, they hold up and destroy a liquor store, killing the clerk and a cop. Two witnesses they held hostage in the store escape during the shooting. They still hold a bank clerk hostage in the trunk of their car, whom Richie later rapes and murders.\nThe Fuller family \u2014 Jacob, the father and a pastor who is experiencing a crisis of faith; his son Scott; and daughter Kate \u2014 are on a vacation in their RV. They stop at a motel and are promptly kidnapped by the Geckos, who force the Fullers to smuggle them past the Mexican border. Seth and Jacob make an uneasy truce: if the Geckos can make it past the border, Jacob and his family will come out of the ordeal unharmed. They arrive at the \"Titty Twister\", a strip club in the middle of a desolate part of Mexico, where the Geckos will be met by their contact Carlos at dawn. The Geckos demand that the Fullers have a drink with them before leaving, despite Kate's obvious discomfort.\nSoon after entering the club, chaos ensues as the employees and strippers are all revealed to be vampires. Most of the patrons are quickly killed, and Richie is bitten by the star stripper, Santanico Pandemonium, and bleeds to death. Only Seth, Jacob, Kate, Scott, a biker named Sex Machine and Frost, a Vietnam War veteran, survive the attack. The slain patrons \u2014 including Richie \u2014 then come back to life as vampires, forcing Seth to kill his own brother.\nDuring this second struggle, one of the vampires bites Sex Machine in the arm. Subsequently, Sex Machine changes into a vampire and bites Frost and Jacob before Frost throws Sex Machine through the door, which allows an army of vampires to enter as bats from the outside. Seth and the Fullers desperately escape to a back storeroom and fashion anti-vampire weapons from items found therein, including a pneumatic drill, crossbow, shotgun, and holy water, which requires Jacob to recover his faith to bless. Jacob, knowing he will soon turn into a vampire, makes a reluctant Scott and Kate promise to kill him when he changes.\nThe four make their final assault on the undead. Jacob changes, but Scott hesitates to dispatch his father, allowing Jacob to bite Scott. Scott hits Jacob with holy water and shoots him. Scott is captured by several vampires who begin to devour him. Begging for death, Scott is shot by Kate. Only Seth and Kate survive, surrounded by vampires. Just as they contemplate suicide, streams of sunlight shine through new holes in the walls, making the vampires back away. Dawn has come, and Carlos is trying to shoot his way in.

Contrasting with the opportunism of Transome is the sincere, but opinionated, Radical Felix Holt. A subplot concerns the stepdaughter of a Dissenting minister who is the true heir to the Transome estate, but who is unaware of the fact. She becomes the object of the affections of both Harold Transome and Felix Holt.As the story starts, the reader is introduced to the fictitious community of Treby in the English Midlands in 1832, around the time of the First Reform Act. Harold Transome, a local landowner, has returned home after a fifteen-year trading career in the Far East. Wealthy from trade, he stands for election to Parliament from the county seat of North Loamshire. But contrary to his family's Tory traditions, he intends to stand as a Radical. This alienates him from his traditional allies and causes despair for his mother, Mrs. Transome. Harold Transome gains the support of his Tory uncle, the Rector of Little Treby, and enlists the help of his family lawyer, Matthew Jermyn, as an electioneering agent.\nMuch of his electioneering is focused in Treby Magna. In this village resides Felix Holt, who has recently returned from extensive travels in Glasgow to live with his mother. He meets with Rev. Rufus Lyon, a Dissenting minister in Treby Magna, and his stepdaughter, Esther. Felix and Mr. Lyon become ready friends, but he appears to treat Esther with condescension. Felix and Rev. Lyon both appear aligned to the Radical cause.\nHarold Transome learns that Jermyn has been mismanaging the Transome estate and embezzling money for himself. Transome remains silent during the election, yet Jermyn tries to devise a plan to save himself from future prosecution. Meanwhile, Felix witnesses some electioneering for the Radical cause in the nearby mining town of Sproxton. He is upset with the 'treating' of workers with beer in exchange for their vocal support. Felix relays his concerns to Harold Transome, who chastises John Johnson for his electioneering methods. However, Jermyn convinces Transome not to interfere.\nRev. Lyon learns from Maurice Christian, servant of Philip Debarry, about the possible identity of Esther's biological father. Rev. Lyon decides to tell Esther the truth about her father. Esther's outlook on life changes upon finding that she is in fact Rev. Lyon's stepdaughter. Her relationship with her stepfather deepens, while she also desires to emulate the high moral standards impressed upon her by Felix Holt. Seeing the change in Esther's character, Felix Holt begins to fall in love with her. However, both share the feeling that they are destined never to marry each other. Meanwhile, Rev. Lyon challenges Rev. Augustus Debarry to a theological debate. The debate is initially agreed to, but is cancelled at the last minute.\nRiots erupt on election day in Treby Magna. Drunken mine workers from Sproxton assault townspeople and wantonly destroy property. Felix Holt is caught up in the riots, and tries foolhardily to direct its hostility away from the town. But in the end, Felix Holt is charged with the manslaughter of a constable who tried to break up the riot. Harold Transome also loses the election to Debarry.\nHarold Transome begins legal proceedings against Jermyn for the latter's mismanagement of the Transome estate. Jermyn counters by threatening to publicise the true owner of the Transome estate. However, Maurice Christian informs the Transomes that the true owner of the estate is in fact Esther Lyon. Harold Transome invites her to the Transome estate, hoping to persuade her to marry him. Harold and Esther establish a good rapport, and Esther also becomes more sympathetic with Mrs. Transome, whose despair has continued to deepen. Esther feels torn between Harold Transome and Felix Holt. She compares a life of comfortable wealth with Harold Transome and motherly affection with Mrs. Transome, to a life of personal growth in poverty with Felix Holt. Meanwhile, at Felix Holt's trial, Rev. Lyon, Harold Transome and Esther Lyon all vouch for his character, but he is nevertheless found guilty of manslaughter. However, Harold Transome and the Debarrys manage to have Felix Holt pardoned.\nHarold Transome proposes to Esther Lyon, with the eager support of Mrs. Transome. But despite Esther's feelings towards both Harold and Mrs. Transome, she declines the proposal. In an altercation between Jermyn and Harold Transome, it is revealed that Jermyn is Harold Transome's father. Harold considers he will no longer be suitable for marriage to Esther. Esther also surrenders her claim to the Transome estate. The story ends with Felix Holt and Esther Lyon marrying and moving away from Treby, along with Rev. Lyon. Matthew Jermyn is eventually ruined and moves abroad, while John Johnson remains and prospers as a lawyer. The Debarrys remain friends with the Transomes, and the contest to the Transome estate, while widely known, is never discussed.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "in the Far East"}], "question": "Where has Harold Transome been for the past 15 years when the story starts?", "id": "ced259f88228bea5f1d29e0bc784c28ad8b8c4cb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "she is his stepdaughter"}], "question": "What relation is Esther to Rev.

Reinhard, who's five years older than Elisabeth, impresses her by writing fairy tales on slips of paper for her. Without Elisabeth knowing, Reinhard additionally keeps a vellum-bound book in which he composes poems about his life experiences.\nDespite his young age, Reinhard is sure that he wants to spend his whole life with Elisabeth. Neither a new school, nor his new male friends can change this. He reveals his childhood dream of a life together in India to Elisabeth. After a moment of hesitation, 5-year old Elisabeth approves to his future plans.\nAt the age of seventeen, the moment of separation from Elisabeth comes inescapably closer. Although he will pursue his education in town, Reinhard promises to continue writing fairy tales for her and send them by letter to his mother. She is delighted about this idea for she cannot imagine a life without Reinhard.\nSoon enough Christmas Eve comes along. Reinhard spends his time with his fellow students in the Ratskeller, where he shows interest to a girl playing the zither accompanied by a fiddler. After acting coy, she eventually sings for Reinhard. However, he offends her by heading home in a rush after receiving a message from an arrival. There Reinhard finds a parcel. Excited, he looks at the parcel's content. Besides a cake and some personal items the parcel also contains letters from Elizabeth and his mother. In her letter Elisabeth complains about the death of the bird which Reinhard gave her as a present. Furthermore, she reproaches him for not writing fairy tales for her anymore. He is overwhelmed by a desire to return home. Immediately, he writes letters to Elisabeth and his mother after taking a walk, during which he gives half of the cake to a beggar girl.\nAt Easter, after a long-awaited time, Reinhard returns to see Elisabeth. However, they seem to have grown apart. In Reinhard's absence, his old schoolfriend Erich has inherited his father's farm at Immensee. Erich gave a new bird to Elisabeth. Reinhard entrusts his personal diary to Elisabeth, who is unsettled by the many poems he dedicated to her. When he asks her to hand him the book back, she returns it to him along with his favourite flower. Shortly before his departure Reinhard makes Elisabeth promise that she will still love him after his two-year absence. He leaves having told her that he has a secret, which he vows to tell her upon his return. Two more years pass by with no more correspondence between the two of them, then Reinhard gets a letter from his mother about Elisabeth and Erich's engagement. Elisabeth had twice rejected Erich's proposal.\nA few years later Reinhard accepts Erich's invitation to Immensee without Elisabeth and her mother knowing. Elisabeth is very happy about Reinhard's unexpected arrival. Reinhard has collected several poems and songs over the last few years and now he is asked to perform some of his latest folksongs. With the evening drawing near, Reinhard recites some verses of a romantic drama, prompting Elisabeth to leave the small party embarrassed. Shortly afterwards, Reinhard is on his way down to the lake where he tries to reach a water lily by swimming into the middle. He cannot reach it and returns to the shore scared.\nThe following afternoon Reinhard and Elisabeth go for a walk on the other side of the lake. Discovering a field of erica and listening to Reinhard's words about lost youth bring tears to Elisabeth's eyes. In silence they make their way back to the house by boat but Reinhard returns alone later.\nDuring the whole time at the manor Reinhard is not able to express his thoughts. He decides to abandon Immensee early next morning, leaving a note behind but Elisabeth surprises him when she anticipates his plan to depart and never come back. He withdraws himself from her sight stepping outside and taking off.\nAt late dusk, in his mind's eye, the old man once more catches sight of the water lily on the lake through the window. The lily seems to be close but still unreachable. He remembers his bygone youth and delves into his studies, to which he dedicated a lot of time in the past.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Writes fairy tales."}], "question": "What does Reinhard do to impress Elisabeth?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Five years old"}], "question": "How old is Elisabeth when Reinhard tells her he wants to spend his whole life with her?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "with fellow students"}], "question": "Who does Reinhard spend Christmas Eve with?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Erich"}], "question": "Who inherited his father's farm?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A bird"}], "question": "What did Erich give Elisabeth?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That she will still love him when he retuns."}], "question": "What does Reinhard make Elisabeth promise him?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Erich"}], "question": "Who proposed to Elisabeth?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A water lily."}], "question": "What does Reinhard try to reach in the water?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Listening to Reinhard's words of lost youth."}], "question": "What brings tears to Elisabeth's eyes?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Five"}], "question": "How many years older is Reinhard than Elisabeth?", "id": "cee9ed60009c325382f35d5c81a5c22ab3cf9200"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By writting fairy tale on slips of paper for her.

Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death and, as children, formed a pact to die together. One night, while on the way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period, which results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature wounds and bites Ginger, but Brigitte rescues her. As the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam MacDonald, a local drug dealer. Ginger decides not to go the hospital as her wounds heal quickly.\nFollowing the attack, Ginger undergoes physical and mental transformations that concern Brigitte. Ginger starts to behave aggressively and grow hair from her wounds, sprouts a tail, and heavily menstruates. Ignoring Brigitte's warnings, Ginger has unprotected sex with a classmate named Jason and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte and Sam agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is in the process of turning into one. On Sam's advice, Brigitte persuades Ginger to have her navel pierced using a silver ring in the hopes of curing her. Instead, it proves ineffective. Sam then suggests a monkshood solution, which is not possible as the plant is only found in the spring.\nLater, Trina shows up at the Fitzgerald house to accuse Ginger of kidnapping her dog. As she fights with Ginger, Trina is accidentally killed when she slips and hits her head on the kitchen counter. The sisters narrowly avoid their parents as they put the body in a freezer, explaining the blood to be part of another school project. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers while trying to get the corpse from the freezer. They lose the fingers when they bury Trina's body. Brigitte tells Ginger she can't go out anymore, but Ginger remains defiant.\nOn Halloween, Brigitte takes monkshood purchased by her mother and asks Sam to make the cure. While trying to track down Ginger, Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected by Ginger due to unprotected sex) and she defends herself by using the cure on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behavior, which proves the cure's success. At school, Brigitte finds that Ginger has murdered the guidance counselor, Mr. Wayne, and is a witness to her killing of the school's janitor.\nThe girls' mother discovers Trina's corpse and goes looking for her daughters. While she is looking for them, she sees Brigitte running and picks her up. As she drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, she tells her that she will burn the house down by letting it fill up with gas then lighting a match to erase evidence of Trina's death. Brigitte arrives to find Sam rejecting Ginger's advances. As he approaches Ginger, she breaks his arm. In despair, Brigitte infects herself as Sam pleads with her not to. As the sisters leave, Sam knocks Ginger out with a shovel. Brigitte and Sam then take her back to the Fitzgerald house in his van, and prepare more of the cure for Ginger.\nGinger fully transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Aware that she has transformed, Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as he makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, Ginger mutilates Sam. Brigitte picks up the dropped syringe and follows the blood trail downstairs. After finding an injured and bloody Sam she tries to save him by drinking his blood in an attempt to calm Ginger, but can't go through with it. Ginger sees Brigitte's revulsion and kills Sam in front of her by biting him in the jugular.\nAs Ginger stalks Brigitte through the basement, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Finding the knife that Ginger had been using to remove her tail, Brigitte holds the cure in one hand and the knife in the other. Ginger lunges at her, becoming fatally stabbed with the knife. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and sobs.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ginger"}], "question": "Who kills the janitor and guidance counselor?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She sees Brigitte's revulsion at the idea of drinking Sam's blood."}], "question": "Why does Ginger kill Sam in front of Brigitte?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Trina"}], "question": "Who confronts Ginger about the death of her dog?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brigitte uses the monkshood on Jason."}], "question": "How is Jason cured?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had unprotected sex with Ginger."}], "question": "How is Jason infected?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a werewolf"}], "question": "What does Sam and Brigitte believe attacked Ginger?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He thought it would cure her."}], "question": "Why did Sam advise Brigitte to convince Ginger to get a silver belly ring?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bailey Downs"}], "question": "What suburb is experiencing a problem with dog killings?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "death"}], "question": "What are Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald fascinated by?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ginger"}], "question": "Who undergoes physical and mental changes as a result of an attack by a creature?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To die together."}], "question": "What kind of pact do the two teenage sisters form?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is attacked by the dog creature responsible for the maulings."}], "question": "What is caused directly by Ginger beginning her first period?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sam"}], "question": "Who runs over the creature after Ginger is bitten?", "id": "cf09f10dcf0a2d000a7d2a0fc776f16a0e5a86be"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Piercing her naval with a silver ring.

The youth is a skilled but violent warrior, who his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. Thousands of years ago, the Mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, which were scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask, and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.\nYears later, Conan has become a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it, killing all of the slave handlers in the process. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by a man whom Conan recognizes as Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the body of the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the rest of the prisoners to escape, and, in gratitude, Ela-Shan tells Conan that, if he ever needs him, Conan will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is then killed by the prisoners.\nZym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery where they hope to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique also slays several of the priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures one of Zym's men, Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.\nZym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique assists her father by invoking soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a poison-laced boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, stationed nearby, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, but although they kill several of Conan's men, they are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.\nConan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle unnoticed. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, eventually reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and defeats Marique, cutting off her hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.\nConan and Tamara become trapped on an unstable bridge as Zym attacks them. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress who was executed by the monks from Tamara's monastery for attempting to unleash occult forces to destroy Hyborea, and Maliva's spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he refuses and instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. The power-hungry ruler falls into the lava below the precipice crying out to his wife.\nConan and Tamara escape and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they'll meet again. He then returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Khalar Zym"}], "question": "Who attacks Conan's village?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A group of sorcerers"}], "question": "Who crafted the mask thousands of years ago?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Conan"}], "question": "Who was the only survivor of the village after Zym left?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Prisoners"}], "question": "Who is Lucius killed by?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "City of Thieves, Argalon"}], "question": "Where does Ela-Shan tell Conan he can be found at if needed?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A poison-laced boomerang sword"}], "question": "What was Conan poisoned with?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tamara"}], "question": "Whose body does Zym want to use for his wife's soul?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marique"}], "question": "Whose hand does Tamara cut off, while in battle?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Maliva"}], "question": "What is the name of Zym's deceased wife?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Zym"}], "question": "Who dies by falling into lava?", "id": "d15686cf4482b52351e990ccd991fefda8d2f6dc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The son of Corin, the leader of a barbarian tribe.

The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi). Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale).\nIn New York City, detectives Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Cloudy goes in to make an arrest, but the suspect makes a break for it, cutting Cloudy on the arm with a knife. After catching up with their suspect and severely beating him, the detectives interrogate the man, who reveals his drug connection.\nLater, Popeye and Cloudy go out for drinks at the Copacabana, where Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his young wife Angie (Arlene Farber) entertaining mob members involved in narcotics. They decide to tail the couple, and soon learn that the Bocas, who run a modest newsstand luncheonette, have criminal records: Sal for armed robbery and murder, and Angie for shoplifting. The detectives suspect that the Bocas, who frequent several nightclubs and drive expensive cars, are involved in some kind of criminal operation. They soon establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary), who is part of the narcotics underworld.\nSoon after, Popeye learns from an informant that a major shipment of heroin will arrive in the New York area. The detectives convince their supervisor, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan), to wiretap the Bocas' phones, and they use several ruses to obtain additional information. Popeye and Cloudy are joined in the investigation by a federal agent named Mulderig (Bill Hickman). Popeye and Mulderig dislike each other based on having worked together in the past, with Mulderig holding Popeye responsible for the death of a policeman.\nAfter Devereaux's Lincoln Continental Mark III arrives in New York City, Weinstock's chemist (Pat McDermott) tests a sample of the heroin and declares it the purest he has ever seen, establishing that the shipment could make as much as $32 million on a half-million dollar investment. Boca is impatient to make the purchase\u2014reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible\u2014while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.\nCharnier soon realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes, waving tauntingly on the departing subway shuttle from Grand Central Terminal. To avoid being tailed, he has Sal Boca instead meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly so he can return to France. On the flight back to New York, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\nSoon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye from the roof of Doyle's apartment complex but misses. Popeye chases after the fleeing sniper, who boards an elevated train at the Bay 50th Street Station in Gravesend. Doyle commandeers a car and gives chase along Stillwell Avenue. Realizing he is pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, kills a policeman who tries to intervene and then hijacks the motorman at gunpoint forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also killing the train conductor who gets too close. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into another, stationary, train, when an emergency trackside brake engages violently hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives limping, having wrecked the commandeered car, and sees the killer descending from the platform. When he sees Doyle, he turns to run but is shot dead by Doyle with a single shot.\nAfter a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team take it apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty-handed. Then Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize the contraband must still be in the car. This time they remove the rocker panels and discover the obloid packages (some light blue and some light green) of heroin concealed therein. The police then restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln to Charnier.\nCharnier drives to an old factory on Wards Island to meet Weinstock, and about a dozen others, and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the bags of drugs, and hides the money; concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car that was purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will then take back to France. With their transaction complete, Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but almost immediately hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye Doyle, who playfully waves to Charnier. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Sal is killed with two shotgun blasts during a shootout with the police and most of the other criminals surrender.\nCharnier, however, escapes into the old warehouse and Popeye follows after him, with Cloudy joining in the hunt. When Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance, he empties his revolver a split-second after shouting a warning. The man whom Popeye kills, however, is not Charnier but Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room, and a few seconds later, a single gunshot is heard.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In the rocker panels of the car."}], "question": "Where is the contraband hidden?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mulderig, and possibly Charnier."}], "question": "Who does Popeye kill?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle, and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo"}], "question": "Who are the two main protagonists?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Alain Charnier and Pierre Nicoli."}], "question": "Who are the two main antagonists?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The detectives are investigating narcotics smuggling."}], "question": "What is the main criminal activity that the detectives are investigating?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "120 pounds of heroin."}], "question": "How much heroin is estimated to be smuggled during this story?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Approximately 32 million per half million invested."}], "question": "How much money could this heroin be worth to the investors?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The couple has criminal backgrounds and they drive expensive cars."}], "question": "Why do Cloudy and Popeye suspect the Boccas are involved in something illegal?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The detectives send the car on for the exchange of money for drugs, and then they attempt arrest."}], "question": "After the drugs were found in the car, what do the detectives do?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By hiding it in the vehicle of his unknowing friend Henry Devereaux."}], "question": "How does Charnier plan to smuggle $32 million of heroin into the United States?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they were entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics smuggling."}], "question": "Why do Popeye and Cloudy decide to tail Sal and Angie?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Joel Winstock, a lwayer with ties to the narcotics underground."}], "question": "Who do Popeye and Cloudy draw a connection beetween the Bocas and drug connections?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because they've worked together in the past and Muldering blaming Popeye for the death of a policeman"}], "question": "Why do Popeye and Mulderig dislike each other?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because he knows the Bocas phones have been tapped and they are under investigation."}], "question": "Why does Winstock urge more patience on selling the heroin smuggled in the car from France?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He realizes he is being followed by the police, and he figures out Popeye is the officer investigating him, sneaking aay on the subway elsewhere."}], "question": "What happens when Charnier arrives in New York?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He knows another officer will just take his place."}], "question": "Why does Charnier ask that Popeye is not killed?", "id": "d2e4700544066553a0c434d4861e9b7c4cdfbd7b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He misses Popeye, leading to Popeye chasing him across rooftops and eventually in cars.

While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas. They share a passionate kiss, though he does not get her name. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received, making him a favorite for the 2010 race.\nA month later, David prepares for a new job. At Madison Square Park, near David's home, a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from Richardson, his boss: ensure David spills coffee on his shirt by 7:05 AM so he misses his bus. Mitchell falls asleep and misses David, who encounters Elise on the bus and gets her phone number. David arrives at work to find his friend Charlie Traynor frozen in time and being examined by unfamiliar men. David attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. Richardson explains he and his men are from the \"Adjustment Bureau\". They ensure people's lives proceed as determined by \"the Plan\", a complex document Richardson attributes to \"the Chairman\". The Bureau confiscates and destroys the note that contains Elise's phone number, and David is warned that if he reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else, he will be \"reset\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094akin to being lobotomized. He is not meant to meet Elise again.\nThree years later, after boarding a bus, David encounters Elise; he tells her he spent three years riding that bus to work, hoping to see her. He learns that she dances for Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet. The Bureau tries to stop him from renewing their relationship by altering their schedules. David races across town, fighting the Bureau's abilities to \"control his choices\" to ensure he will meet Elise. During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to distant locations. Senior official Thompson takes over David's adjustment and takes him to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path.\nThompson says humanity received free will after the height of the Roman Empire, but then brought the Dark Ages upon itself. The Bureau took control after five centuries of barbarism, and created the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution; when free will was granted in 1910 it resulted in World War I, the Great Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust and the Cuban Missile Crisis, forcing the Bureau to retake control. Thompson implies that without Elise's influence David might become President of the United States, and warns that if he stays with her, he will ruin their futures. Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power, and David abandons her at the hospital to save them from the fate Thompson described.\nEleven months later, Charlie tells David of Elise's imminent wedding as he campaigns again. Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water, which prevents the Bureau from tracking them. Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elise's relationship, and teaches David how to use doors to teleport and evade the Bureau's adjustments. Just before the wedding David reaches Elise, reveals the Bureau's existence to her, and shows her how he travels through doors. The Bureau pursues them across New York City. David decides to find the Chairman to end the chase, with Elise accompanying him. They enter the Bureau's offices with agents in pursuit.\nDavid and Elise find themselves surrounded on the observation deck of the GE Building. They declare their love and kiss before David can be reset. When they let go of each other, the Bureau members have gone. Thompson appears but is interrupted by Harry, who shows him a revised Plan from the Chairman: one that is blank starting from the current moment. Harry commends them for their devotion to each other, then says they are free to leave. David and Elise walk down the street as Harry speculates that the Chairman's goal may be to prepare humanity to write its own \"Plans\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "At 7:05

Tyler Hawkins audits classes at NYU and works at the university bookstore. He has a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles, because his older brother, Michael, committed suicide years before. Charles ignores his youngest child, Caroline, of whom Tyler is protective.\nOne night with his roommate, Aidan, Tyler gets involved in somebody else's fight and is arrested by Neil. Aiden calls Charles to bail Tyler out, but he does not stick around to have a conversation with his father. Aidan sees Neil dropping Ally off, realizing that she is his daughter. He approaches Tyler with the idea to get back at the detective by persuading him to sleep with and dump Ally. Tyler and Ally go to dinner, kiss at the end of the night, and continue seeing one another. While at Tyler's apartment, Aidan convinces the pair to go to a party, after which Ally is very drunk and ends up crashing there. The following day she and her father argue. Neil slaps her and Ally flees to Tyler's apartment.\nCaroline, a budding artist, is featured in an art show and Tyler asks his father to attend the show. Tyler confronts him in a board room filled with people, which causes his father to explode. Neil's partner recognizes Tyler with Ally on a train, so Neil breaks into Tyler's apartment and confronts him. Tyler provokes Neil by confessing to Aidan's plan and his initial reason for meeting Ally, which forces Tyler to confess to Ally. She leaves and returns home. Aidan visits Ally at her father's home to explain that he is to blame and Tyler is in love with her.\nCaroline is bullied by a classmates at a birthday party where they cut her hair off. Ally and Aidan visit Tyler's mother's apartment where Caroline is sobbing. Tyler accompanies his sister back to school and when her classmates tease her for her new haircut, Tyler turns violent and ends up in jail. Charles is impressed that Tyler stood up for his sister, and they connect. Charles asks Tyler to meet with the lawyers at his office.\nTyler spends the night with Ally and they reveal they love each other after making love. Charles takes Caroline to school. He calls Tyler to let him know this and tell him he'll be late. Tyler is happy his father is spending time with Caroline. He tells Charles he will wait in his office, He sees on Charles's computer, a slideshow of pictures of Tyler, Michael and Caroline when they were younger.\nAfter Charles drops Caroline off at school, she sits in her classroom, where the teacher writes the date on the blackboard as September 11, 2001. Tyler looks out the window of his father's office\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is revealed to be located on the 101st floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Once the 9/11 terrorist attacks begin, the rest of the family, Aidan and Ally look at the towers before the camera pans over the rubble, showing Tyler's diary. In a voice-over of his diary, Tyler reveals to Michael that he loves him, and he forgives him for killing himself. Tyler is buried next to Michael.\nSome time later, Caroline and Charles seem to have a healthy father-daughter relationship. Aidan, who has since gotten a tattoo of Tyler's name on his arm, is working hard in school and Ally gets on the subway at the same spot where her mother was killed .", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "1991"}], "question": "What year was it when Ally's mother got shot?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Police Detective"}], "question": "What is Alley's fathers profession?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aiden"}], "question": "Who is Tyler's roommate?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To bail out Tyler."}], "question": "Why does Aiden call Charles?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tyler's apartment."}], "question": "Where does Ally go after her father slaps her?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "September 11, 2001"}], "question": "What does the teacher write on the blackboard in Carolines classroom?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "101st"}], "question": "Where floor was Tyler's fathers office?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Michael"}], "question": "Who is Tyler buried next to?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aiden"}], "question": "Who gets a tattoo with Tylers name?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She was shot."}], "question": "What happened to Alyssa Craig's mother?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is his sister."}], "question": "What is Caroline's relationship to Tyler Hawkins?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is her father."}], "question": "What is Neil's relationship to Alyssa Craig?", "id": "d5b32abd0fe5966b8c619084932c5d832d51f063"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was arrested.

The story starts with him aboard a San Francisco ferry, called Martinez, which collides with another ship in the fog and sinks. He is set adrift in the Bay, eventually being picked up by Wolf Larsen. Larsen is the captain of a seal-hunting schooner, the Ghost. Brutal and cynical, yet also highly intelligent and intellectual (though highly biased in his opinions, as he was self-taught), he rules over his ship and terrorizes the crew with the aid of his exceptionally great physical strength. Van Weyden adequately describes him as an individualist, hedonist, and materialist. Larsen does not believe in the immortality of the soul, he finds no meaning in his life save for survival and pleasure and has come to despise all human life and deny its value. Being interested in someone capable of intellectual disputes, he somewhat takes care of Van Weyden, whom he calls 'Hump', while forcing him to become a cabin boy, do menial work, and learn to fight to protect himself from a brutal crew.\nA key event in the story is an attempted mutiny against Wolf Larsen by several members of the crew. The organizers of the mutiny are Leach and Johnson. Johnson had previously been beaten severely by Larsen, and Leach had been punched earlier while being forced to become a boat-puller, motivating the two. The first attempt is by sending Larsen overboard; however, he manages to climb back onto the ship. Searching for his assailant, he ventures into the sleeping quarters, located beneath the main deck, the only exit being a ladder. Several, at least seven men, take part in the mutiny and attack Larsen. Larsen however, demonstrating his inhuman endurance, strength, and conviction, manages to fight his way through the crew, climb the ladder with several men hanging off him, and escape relatively unharmed. Van Weyden is promoted as mate, for the original mate had been murdered. Larsen later gets his vengeance by torturing his crew, and constantly claiming that he is going to murder Leach and Johnson at his earliest convenience, being the hunting season is done, as he can't afford to lose any crew. He later allows them to be lost to the sea when they attempt to flee on a hunting boat.\nDuring this section, the Ghost picks up another set of castaways, including a poet named Maud Brewster. Miss Brewster and van Weyden had known each other previously\u00e2\u0080\u0094but only as writers. Both Wolf Larsen and van Weyden immediately feel attraction to her, due to her intelligence and \"female delicacy\". Van Weyden sees her as his first true love. He strives to protect her from the crew, the horrors of the sea, and Wolf Larsen. As this happens, Wolf Larsen meets his brother Death Larsen, a bitter opponent of his. Wolf kidnapped several of Death's crew and forced them into servitude to fill his own ranks, lost previously during a storm. During one of Wolf Larsen's intense headaches, which render him near immobile, van Weyden steals a boat and flees with Miss Brewster.\nThe two eventually land on an uninhabited island, heavily populated with seals. They hunt, build shelter and a fire, and survive for several days, using the strength they gained while on the Ghost. The Ghost eventually crashes on the island, with Wolf Larsen the only crew member. As a revenge, Death Larsen had tracked his brother, bribed his crew, destroyed his sails, and set Larsen adrift at sea. It is purely by chance that van Weyden and Miss Brewster meet Larsen again.\nVan Weyden obtains all of the weapons including firearms left on the ship, but he cannot bear to murder Larsen, who does not threaten him. Van Weyden and Miss Brewster decide they can repair the ship, but Larsen, who intends to die on the island and take them with him, sabotages any repairs they make. After a headache, Larsen is rendered blind. He feigns paralysis and attempts to murder van Weyden when he draws within arm's reach but just then is hit with a stroke that leaves him blind and the right side of his body paralyzed. His condition only worsens; he loses usage of his remaining arm, leg, and voice. Miss Brewster and van Weyden, unable to bring themselves to leave him to rot, care for him. Despite this kindness, he continues his resistance, setting fire to the bunk's mattress above him.\nVan Weyden finishes repairing the Ghost, and he and Miss Brewster set sail. During a violent storm, Wolf Larsen dies. They give Larsen a burial at sea, an act mirroring an incident van Weyden witnessed when he was first rescued. The story ends with the two being rescued by an American revenue cutter.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A seal-hunting schooner."}], "question": "What is the Ghost?", "id": "d67891bcff4768f4de2137adf792dbeb1c299b69"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Martinez.

By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.\nWaging War (Chinese: \u4f5c\u6230\uff0c\u4f5c\u6218) explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.\nStrategic Attack (Chinese: \u8b00\u653b\uff0c\u8c0b\u653b) defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.\nDisposition of the Army (Chinese: \u8ecd\u5f62\uff0c\u519b\u5f62) explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.\nForces (Chinese: \u5175\u52e2\uff0c\u5175\u52bf) explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.\nWeaknesses and Strengths (Chinese: \u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u865a\u5b9e) explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.\nMilitary Maneuvers (Chinese: \u8ecd\u722d\uff0c\u519b\u4e89) explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.\nVariations and Adaptability (Chinese: \u4e5d\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e5d\u53d8) focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.\nMovement and Development of Troops (Chinese: \u884c\u8ecd\uff0c\u884c\u519b) describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.\nTerrain (Chinese: \u5730\u5f62) looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.\nThe Nine Battlegrounds (Chinese: \u4e5d\u5730) describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.\nAttacking with Fire (Chinese: \u706b\u653b) explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.\nIntelligence and Espionage (Chinese: \u7528\u9593\uff0c\u7528\u95f4) focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Failure"}], "question": "Habitual deviation from the elements of war will cause what?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Quickly"}], "question": "The economy of warfare requires winning battles to be fought how?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Unity"}], "question": "The source of strength in Strategic attack comes from what?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Disposition of Army"}], "question": "Which element of Military engagement requires a Commander to defend its current position before advancing?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Weaknesses and Strengths"}], "question": "Which element of engagement encourages commanders to take advantage of the enemy's mistakes?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "MIlitary maneuvers"}], "question": "The elements discourage direct conflict, but which describes how to win those battles?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Movement and development of troops"}], "question": "Which element describes how to closely watch the intent of others as it moves through a territory?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Terrain"}], "question": "Which element describes the advantages and disadvantages of six field positions?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The nine battlegrounds"}], "question": "Which element lays a plan for each of the stages of battle for the commanders?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Intelligence and Espionage"}], "question": "Which element encourages finding good sources of information and how to manage them?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seven."}], "question": "Detail Assessment and Planning explores the five fundamental factors and how many elements?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Waging War."}], "question": "What explains how to understand the economy of warfare?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Five."}], "question": "How many factors are needed to succeed in any war?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Strategic Attack."}], "question": "What defines the source of strength as unity, not size?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Disposition of the Army."}], "question": "What explains the importance of defending existing positions?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Military Maneuvers."}], "question": "What explains the dangers of direct conflict?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Movement and Development of Troops."}], "question": "What section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Terrain."}], "question": "What looks at the three general areas of resistance?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Nine Battlegrounds."}], "question": "What describes the nine common situations in a campaign?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Intelligence and Espionage."}], "question": "What focuses on the importance of developing good information sources?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rapidly winning decisive engagements."}], "question": "What does success require in a War theator?", "id": "d6cf36363a9fc159d415e534d641f293b5d4b255"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Attaking with fire.

Sergeant Eddie Cusack (Chuck Norris) and his crack team of Chicago Police detectives take their positions, including Lieutenant Kobas (Joseph Kosala), stationed on a rooftop with Detectives Brennan (Ron Dean) and Music (Gene Barge) as lookouts, along with alcoholic Detective Cragie (Ralph Foody) and rookie Nick Kopalas (Joseph Guzaldo) in a cemetery. An undercover informant is about to meet a buyer at an 'L (or \"el\")' train stop. Cusack and partner Dorato (Dennis Farina) use a garbage truck to patrol beneath the train tracks.\nThe carefully orchestrated sting is a basic meet-and-greet exchange set up by cocaine supplier Victor Comacho (Ron Henriquez). Victor is the younger brother of Luis Comacho (Henry Silva), leader of a vicious drug gang known as the Comachos. Everything goes horribly wrong when a rival gang led by mafia drug lord Tony Luna (Mike Genovese) infiltrates the sting as a crew of painters and mercilessly guns down the attendees. After money and cocaine are exchanged, the aftermath is grim; Cusack's informant is dead and Dorato is wounded. Kopalas is also eyewitness as Cragie accidentally guns down a teenager, then plants his backup weapon on the victim.\nKopalas is partnered with Cusack, with Cragie put on a desk until a department hearing. Commander Kates (Bert Remsen) expresses disgust with the outcome of the sting, while Eddie notes that the Comachos won't take the hit on their gang lightly. Kates agrees. He releases Eddie with one warning: \"Find who burned the Comachos before they do.\"\nAfter learning that one of his gang members was shot by police, and that Victor Comacho survived, Tony Luna decides to leave town. He asks Lou Gamiani (Lou Damiani) to have someone guard his daughter, Diana Luna (Molly Hagan), a young artist. Gamiani feels he has put the entire outfit at risk.\nApart from breaking in a new partner, and the introduction of the new Prowler police three-axle robot, Eddie is shunned by other officers for his refusal to sign a petition to have Cragie cleared. He bluntly tells Brennan: \"If Cragie doesn't get off the streets, he's gonna kill somebody else, or get somebody killed.\"\nTailing Gamiani to the Lincoln Park Zoo, the detectives witness a tense exchange between him and Diana. Cusack discovers who Diana's father is. He and Kopalas stake out the Luna residence as the Comacho funeral procession comes through the neighborhood. They visit Tony Luna's uncle, Felix Scalese (Nathan Davis), to request he stop the imminent conflict.\nResponding to a DOA call in Lincoln Park, Brennan and Music identify the victim, who had been given a \"Colombian Necktie\", as Tony Luna's bag man. Brennan notes another call to Luna's restaurant, where the officers found the mutilated owner hanging from a meat hook. A car lot run by Tony Luna is firebombed and the owner burned alive. A vicious gang war has begun.\nPosing as food vendors, the Comachos brutally gun down every member of the Luna household. Cusack, knowing they will go after Diana to bring Luna out of hiding, tries to get to her first. Gamiani is stabbed to death. Cusack and Kopalas arrive on the scene. Cusack takes off after Diana, who is being chased by several Comacho gang members. In an alley. Cusack surprises them at gunpoint. One takes Diana hostage with a knife, but Cusack disarms the three remaining suspects and goes after the one with the girl. He follows them to the Randolph/Wells (CTA) elevated station and boards a train. A standoff ensues, leading to a fight on the roof of the eight-car train. At a bridge crossing, the gang member jumps into the Chicago River, where he is run over by a speedboat.\nCusack then places Diana in a safe house with his old friend Pirelli (Allen Hamilton), a retired Chicago police officer who was the partner of Cusack's father. At a hearing, Kopalas decides to back Cragie's story. Other officers resent Cusack for his testimony, where it is revealed that he once documented a transfer order to have Cragie transferred out of his unit. Hence, a \"Code of Silence\" is in effect against Cusack, with his only confidant being Detective Dorato.\nPirelli ends up dead and Diana missing. Cusack races toward the Comacho hangout and puts out a radio call for backup, but due to the hearing, other officers refuse to respond. He fights off Luis and other Comacho gang members by himself. Luis tells Cusack he wants Tony Luna, otherwise Diana dies, painfully and slowly.\nDorato tips off Cusack that Tony Luna was lying low in Wisconsin, returning to Chicago that night by train. Eddie waits outside the station, watching as Luna climbs into Scalese's limousine. Scalese chastises his nephew for igniting a gang war. The driver notices Cusack following and a wild chase ensues. The limo strikes a stalled car and overturns onto its roof, with Luna and Scalese killed in the explosion. Cusack, in need of a partner, returns to police headquarters and retrieves the Prowler robot, single-handedly launching a full-scale attack on the Comachos' lair in East Chicago, Indiana.\nOther detectives berate Cusack for his actions. Kopalas, fed up, tells everyone off and confronts Cragie, stating that he will no longer lie for him. He reveals to the squadroom that Cragie planted the gun on the teen he killed.\nCusack takes down the remaining Comacho members. Luis, wounded, enters a bathroom where Diana is bound. He raises a hammer, but Cusack shoots and kills him.\nBackup arrives at last. Cusack places Diana in the care of the CFD ambulance crew. Commander Kates asks will he come in the next day, and Cusack, finally having regained the respect from his fellow officers, agrees. Dorato gives him a ride back to headquarters.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A sting operation."}], "question": "What is taking place during the beginning of the story?", "id":

Egotist\"\u2014The novel centers on Amory Blaine, a young Midwesterner who, convinced that he has an exceptionally promising future, attends boarding school and later Princeton University. He leaves behind his eccentric mother Beatrice and befriends a close friend of hers, Monsignor Darcy. While at Princeton he goes back to Minneapolis, where he re-encounters Isabelle Borg\u00e9, a young lady whom he had met as a little boy, and starts a romantic relationship with her. At Princeton he repeatedly writes ever more flowery poems, but Amory and Isabelle become disenchanted with each after meeting again at his prom.\n\"Interlude\"\u2014Following their break-up, Amory is shipped overseas, to serve in the army in World War I. (Fitzgerald had been in the army himself, but the war ended while he was still stationed on Long Island.) Amory's experiences in the war are not described, other than to say later in the book that he was a bayonet instructor.\n\"Book Two: The Education of a Personage\"\u2014After the war, Amory falls in love with a New York debutante named Rosalind Connage. Because he is poor, however, this relationship collapses as well; Rosalind decides to marry a wealthy man, instead. A devastated Amory is further crushed to learn that his mentor Monsignor Darcy has died.

One evening, Charley discovers that his new next door neighbour Jerry Dandrige, is a vampire responsible for the disappearences of several victims. Charley tries to tell his mother and asks his friends for help. In desperation, he contacts the police, but they believe that he is imagining things and ignore his claims after revealing his suspicions to them when he accompanies a homicide officer to Jerry's house. That night, Charley gets a visit from Jerry, who offers Charley a \"choice\" by forgetting about his vampire identity, but he refuses by using his crucifix on Jerry. When Jerry stops Charley and slowly tries to push him out the window to his death, he stabs Jerry's hand with a pencil. Enraged, Jerry destroys Charley's car in retaliation and threatens Charley that he plans to do much worse to him later.\nCharley turns to Peter Vincent for help, but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan. Charley's girlfriend, Amy Peterson, fears for Charley's sanity and safety, resulting her hiring the destitute Vincent to \"prove\" that Jerry is not a vampire by having him drink what they claim is \"holy water\", but it turns out to only be tap water; Jerry having claimed to Peter that drinking actual holy water would be against his religious convictions. Vincent discovers Jerry's true nature after glancing at his pocket mirror and noticing Jerry's lack of a reflection, causing him to accidentally drop and smash the mirror. Vincent then flees, but Jerry learns of his discovery after finding a piece of his pocket mirror on the floor.\nJerry hunts down and turns Charley's friend, \"Evil\" Ed Thompson, into a vampire. Evil then visits Vincent and tries to attack him, only to be warded off when injured by a crucifix. Meanwhile, Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a club. While Charley is trying to call the police for help, Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy who bears a resemblance to Jerry's lost love (whom Jerry has a painting of). With nowhere left to turn, Charley attempts to gain Vincent's help once more. A frightened Vincent (following Evil's attack) initially refuses, but he then reluctantly resumes his \"Vampire Killer\" role as Charley approaches his neighbour's house. The two are able to repel Jerry's attack using a crucifix, though only Charley's works since he has faith in its spiritual power. Jerry's protector, Billy Cole, appears and knocks Charley unconscious over the banister, having Vincent flees to Charley's house. At his house, he finds that Mrs. Brewster is still not home and is attacked by Evil, who transforms into a wolf. Vincent seemingly kills him after staking him through the heart but later removes the stake. Meanwhile, an unconscious Charley is taken to Amy who has been turned into a vampire by Jerry. Vincent says the process can be reversed, but only if they kill Jerry before dawn.\nCharley and Vincent are then confronted by Billy whom Vincent shoots since he saw his reflection in the mirror. However, Billy is revealed to be a zombie-like creature, who rises again and continues advancing towards them until he is killed by Charley who stakes him and then melts into goo and dust. Jerry appears, but Vincent is able to lure the overconfident vampire in front of a window using a crucifix (now working due to his renewed faith in its abilities). Just before the morning sun, Jerry transforms into a bat and attacks Vincent and Charley (biting Charley in the process) before fleeing to his coffin in the basement. Charley and Vincent go in pursuit of Jerry; Vincent breaks open Jerry's coffin and tries to stake him through the heart whilst Charley has to fight off Amy who has completed her transformation. By breaking the blacked-out windows in the basement, Vincent and Charley expose Jerry to the sunlight and kills him. Jerry's death leads Amy reverting to her human form and the three embrace.\nA few nights later, Vincent returns to his Fright Night TV series and announces a hiatus from vampires by instead presenting Octaman. The series is being watched by Charley and Amy as they embrace together in bed. When Charley goes to turn off the TV, he at first sees red eyes in Jerry's now-vacant house, but dismisses them. Unbeknownst to both Charley and Amy, a survived Evil with red eyes (hiding in the darkness) laughs and says \"Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Charley Brewster."}], "question": "Who is the main character in the story?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Horror films and a horror TV Show called Fright Night."}], "question": "What is Charley Brewster a fan of?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His next door neighbor Jerry Dandrige."}], "question": "Who does Charley believe is a vampire?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His mom, his friends, and the police."}], "question": "Who does Charley tell about his suspicions of Jerry?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Charley attacks Jerry with his crucifix."}], "question": "What happens when Jerry visits Charley to ask him to forget about him being a vampire?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By saying that it would be against his religion to drink holy water."}], "question": "How does Jerry avoid having to drink holy water?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "By slowly pushing him back towards an open window."}], "question": "How does Jerry first try to kill Charley?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jerry."}], "question": "Who does Charley stab in the hand with a pencil?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He destroys Charley's car."}], "question": "How does Jerry retaliate for being stabbed in the hand with a pencil?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Vincent and Charley break the black-out windows in the basement and expose him to the sunlight."}], "question": "How does Jerry die?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Fright Night"}], "question": "What is the name of the show that Charles Brewster a fan of?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peter Vincent"}], "question": "Which character hosts the show Fright Night?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Vampire"}], "question": "What kind of creature is Jerry Dandrige?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A crucifix"}], "question": "What item does Charles use on Jerry after he refuses to forget that he is a vampire?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Peter Vincent"}], "question": "Who does Charles turn to for help?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ed Thompson"}], "question": "Which friend of Charleys' does Jerry hunt down?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Amy"}], "question": "Which character does Jerry hypnotize in the club?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Billy Cole"}], "question": "What is the name of Jerry's protector?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Bat"}], "question": "What does Jerry transform into right before the sun comes up?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sunlight"}], "question": "What eventually kills Jerry?", "id": "dae7e31c643a625b54fd042a8ecad0d9e964494e"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The crucifix only works when Vincent has faith in its spiritual powers."}], "question": "At times, Vincent's crucifix works to repel vampire attacks, but at other times, it does not.

Peter has complete faith in his flying abilities, so, upon hearing a discussion of his adult life, he is able to escape out of the window of his London home and return to Kensington Gardens. Upon returning to the Gardens, Peter is shocked to learn from the crow Solomon Caw that he is not still a bird, but more like a human\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Solomon says he is crossed between them as a \"Betwixt-and-Between\". Unfortunately, Peter now knows he cannot fly, so he is stranded in Kensington Gardens. At first, Peter can only get around on foot, but he commissions the building of a child-sized thrush's nest that he can use as a boat to navigate the Gardens by way of the Serpentine, the large lake that divides Kensington Gardens from Hyde Park.\nAlthough he terrifies the fairies when he first arrives, Peter quickly gains favour with them. He amuses them with his human ways and agrees to play the panpipes at the fairy dances. Eventually, Queen Mab grants him the wish of his heart, and he decides to return home to his mother. The fairies reluctantly help him to fly home, where he finds his mother is asleep in his old bedroom.\nPeter feels rather guilty for leaving his mother, mostly because he believes she misses him terribly. He considers returning to live with her, but first decides to go back to the Gardens to say his last good-byes. Unfortunately, Peter stays too long in the Gardens, and, when he uses his second wish to go home permanently, he is devastated to learn that, in his absence, his mother has given birth to another boy she can love. Peter returns, heartbroken, to Kensington Gardens.\nPeter later meets a little girl named Maimie Mannering, who is lost in the Gardens. He and Maimie become fast friends, and little Peter asks her to marry him. Maimie is going to stay with him, but realises that her mother must be missing her dreadfully, so she leaves Peter to return home. Maimie does not forget Peter, however, and when she is older, she makes presents and letters for him. She even gives him an imaginary goat which he rides around every night. Maimie is the literary predecessor to the character Wendy Darling in Barrie's later Peter and Wendy story.\nThroughout the novel, Peter misunderstands simple things like children's games.

There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), a Southern gambler and expert gunslinger, who seeks relief from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) are also newly arrived in Tombstone with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), is becoming dependent on a potent narcotic. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with a band of outlaws called the Cowboys, led by \"Curly Bill\" Brocious (Powers Boothe). The Cowboys are identifiable by the red sashes worn around their waist.\nWyatt, though no longer a lawman, is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys as tensions rise. Curly Bill begins shooting aimlessly after a visit to an opium house and is approached by Marshal Fred White (Harry Carey, Jr.) to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang) and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to the legendary Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton (Thomas Haden Church) and other Cowboys are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan (Jon Tenney) with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Clanton and Frank Stilwell close behind, preparing to ambush them. Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely, and then surprises the assassins; he kills Stilwell, but lets Clanton return to send a message. Wyatt announces that he is a U.S. marshal, and that he intends to kill any man that he sees wearing a red sash. Wyatt, Doc, a reformed Cowboy named Sherman McMasters (Michael Rooker), along with their allies Texas Jack Vermillion (Peter Sherayko) and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson (Buck Taylor), join forces to administer justice.\nWyatt and his posse are ambushed in a riverside forest by the Cowboys. Hopelessly surrounded, Wyatt seeks out Curly Bill and kills him. Curly Bill's second-in-command, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn), becomes the new head of the Cowboys. When Doc's health worsens, the group are accommodated by Henry Hooker (Charlton Heston) at his ranch. Ringo sends a messenger (dragging McMasters' corpse) to Hooker's property telling Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities; Wyatt agrees. Wyatt sets off for the showdown, not knowing that Doc had already arrived at the scene. Doc confronts a surprised Ringo and kills him in a duel. Wyatt runs when he hears the gunshot only to encounter Doc. They then press on to complete their task of eliminating the Cowboys. Ike escapes when he gives up his sash, symbolically ending the Cowboys. Doc is sent to a sanatorium in Colorado where he later dies of his illness. At Doc's urging, Wyatt pursues Josephine to begin a new life. The film ends with a narration of an account of their long marriage, ending with Wyatt's death in Los Angeles in 1929.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tuberculosis."}], "question": "What ailment is Doc Holliday suffering from?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Red sashes around their waists."}], "question": "What accessory do The Cowboys wear to identify themselves?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Curly Bill."}], "question": "Who is the leader of The Cowboys?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A lack of witnesses."}], "question": "Why is Curly Bill found not guilty of killing the marshal?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A ban on weapons in city limits."}], "question": "What rule does Virgil make when he becomes the new marshal?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Johnny Ringo."}], "question": "Who takes over The Cowboys when Curly Bill is killed?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Colorado sanatorium."}], "question": "Where does Doc die?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Los Angeles in 1929."}], "question": "Where does Wyatt die?", "id": "dbc088fbc6dd9efb6b6b7d8821f73eb0f1759db4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Gunfight at the O.K.

The curse is an entity created where the person died. Those who encounter this evil supernatural force die; and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passed from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order; the original film is presented in a non-linear narrative.\nThe Saeki family lived happily in suburban Tokyo, but housewife Kayako Saeki fell in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in her diary. However, her husband Takeo discovered the diary. Believing Kayako was having an affair, he became mentally disturbed and murdered his wife by pushing her off the stairs, snapping her neck to a 90 degree angle and crushing her throat. He then drowned his young son Toshio - who witnessed the act - in the bathtub to cover his tracks, along with the pet cat, Mar. Takeo hid the bodies in the attic and closet, before Kayako's ghost murdered him by hanging him with her hair in Toshio's bedroom. Peter came to the Saeki house to speak to Kayako after receiving a letter from her, only to find her corpse. Shocked, he fled the house, killing himself the next day by falling over the balcony of his building complex in front of his wife. The Saeki family rose again as ghosts due to their rage and sorrow, notably Kayako, who appears as an onry\u0139\u008d ghost, leaving the curse on the house.\nThe present timeline starts a few years later with the Williams family moving in from America. While husband Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable. Jennifer is quickly consumed by the curse. Matt returns home to find the house trashed, Emma upset, and his wife dying. Matt and Jennifer are killed by Toshio. Yoko, a careworker, arrives at the house the next day to find Emma alone, and encounters Kayako, who attacks her. Concerned about Yoko's disappearance, her employer Alex sends another careworker, Karen Davis, to take over the care for Emma. At the house, Karen is shocked when she finds a seemingly alive Toshio and Mar in the closet, contacting Alex for help.\nAlex finds Emma dead in the house and Karen in a state of shock after her first encounter with Kayako, and summons the police, including Detective Nakagawa. Nakagawa and his partner Igarashi explore the house, finding the bodies of Matt and Jennifer in the attic along with a human's lower jaw. Matt's sister Susan disappears after being followed and attacked by Kayako, and Alex is killed when visited by a Kayako-possessed Yoko missing her lower jaw. Karen begins to be haunted by Kayako herself, informing her boyfriend Doug of the situation. She researches the origins of the house, eventually confronting Nakagawa, who explains three of his colleagues investigating the Saeki deaths all were consumed by the curse. That night, Nakagawa goes to the house and tries to burn it down, but is killed by Takeo.\nKaren races to the house upon learning Doug has ventured there to look for her, experiencing a vision in which she sees Peter visiting the house and finding Kayako's corpse. Karen finds Doug paralyzed by fear, and attempts to flee the house with him, only to witness Kayako as she drags herself down the stairs and crawls on Doug, causing him to die of fright. Karen spots the petrol and manages to ignite it with Doug's lighter just as Kayako is about to kill her. Karen is whisked to a hospital, but learns the house survived the fire. Visiting Doug's body, Karen realizes she is still haunted by Kayako, who appears behind her as the camera circles to reveal her wide staring eye.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

brink of the First World War, and Anne's youngest daughter Rilla is an irrepressible almost-15-year-old, excited about her first adult party and blissfully unaware of the chaos that the Western world is about to enter. Her parents worry because Rilla seems not to have any ambition, is not interested in attending college, and is more concerned with having fun. (In an aside, it is revealed that Marilla has died; her date of death is not specified but Rilla states it was before she was old enough to know her very well.)\nOnce the Continent descends into war, Jem Blythe and Jerry Meredith promptly enlist, upsetting Anne, Nan, and Faith Meredith (who Rilla suspects is engaged to Jem). Rilla's brother Walter, who is of age, does not enlist, ostensibly due to a recent bout with typhoid but truly because he fears the ugliness of war and death. He confides in Rilla that he feels he is a coward.\nThe enlisted boys report to Kingsport for training. Jem's dog, Dog Monday, takes up a vigil at the Glen train station waiting for Jem to come back. Rilla's siblings Nan, Di, and Walter return to Redmond College, and Shirley returns to Queen's Academy, leaving Rilla anxiously alone at home with her parents, their spinster housekeeper Susan Baker, and Gertrude Oliver, a teacher who is boarding with the Blythes while her fiance reports to the front.\nAs the war drags on, Rilla matures, organizing the Junior Red Cross in her village. While collecting donations for the war effort, she comes across a house where a young mother has just died with her husband away at war, leaving no one to care for her two-week-old son. Rilla takes the sickly little boy back to Ingleside in a soup tureen, naming him \"James Kitchener Anderson\" after his father and Herbert Kitchener, British Secretary of State for War. Rilla's father Gilbert challenges her to raise the war orphan, and although she doesn't like babies at all, she rises to the occasion, eventually coming to love \"Jims\" as her own. She also assists in the elopement of a soldier whose beloved is the daughter of the town's only vocal pacifist; the pacifist's attempts to oppose fund-raising for the war effort or to criticize the war while leading prayers are a recurring minor storyline.\nRilla and her family pay anxious attention to all the war news as the conflict spreads and thousands die. Rilla grows much closer to Walter, who some townsfolk and fellow students have branded a slacker, an insult he feels deeply. Rilla feels that Walter finally regards her as a chum, not just as his little sister. Walter eventually does enlist, as does Rilla's newfound love interest, Kenneth Ford (the son of Owen and Leslie Ford, who met in Anne's House of Dreams), who kisses her before leaving and asks her to promise she will not kiss anyone else until he returns. She keeps this a secret for much of the book, unsure what it means about his feelings for her. Her mother later tells her that \"if Leslie Ford's son asked you to keep your lips for him, I think you may consider yourself engaged to him.\"\nAs the war continues, one night Dog Monday begins to howl inconsolably, leading the family to fear something terrible has happened to Jem. Instead, they receive news that Walter was killed in action at Courcelette. (In Anne of Ingleside, published in 1939 but set many years before Rilla of Ingleside, Montgomery foreshadows Walter's death; Anne sees the shadow of a cross cast from the window over sleeping Walter's head.) In Walter's last letter to Rilla, written the day before his death, he tells her that he is no longer afraid and believes it may be better for him to die than to go on living with his memories of war forever spoiling life's beauty. Rilla gives the letter to Una Meredith, as she has long believed Una had been in love with Walter, though she had never spoken of it to either of them.\nAnne's youngest son, Shirley, comes of age and immediately joins the flying corps. Jerry Meredith is wounded at Vimy Ridge, and in early May 1918, Jem is reported wounded and missing following a trench raid. The Blythes spend nearly five months not knowing Jem's fate, but are encouraged by Dog Monday's continued presence at the train station, as Susan reasons a dog so troubled by the death of his master's brother surely would sense a tragedy involving his master. Finally the family receives a telegram: Jem had been taken prisoner in Germany, but eventually escaped to Holland and is now proceeding to England for medical treatment.\nWhen the war finally ends, the rest of the boys from Glen St. Mary return home. Mary Vance and Miller Douglas announce plans to marry, with Miller deciding to pursue a career in Mr. Flagg's store after losing a leg in the war. Jem returns on an afternoon train and is met by a joyful Dog Monday. Jims' father returns with a young English bride and takes Jims to live with them nearby; Rilla is glad she can still remain part of Jims' life.\nLife after war resumes. Jem plans to return to college, since he and Faith cannot be married until he finishes studying medicine. Faith, Nan, and Diana plan to teach school, while Jerry, Carl, and Shirley will return to Redmond, along with Una, who plans to take a Household Science course. Noting that Kenneth Ford has survived the war but has not contacted her, Rilla concludes that his interest must have faded and she should consider joining the college-bound group.\nFinally, Kenneth returns home and proposes to Rilla with the question \"Is it Rilla-my-Rilla?\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094to which Rilla lisps, \"Yeth,\" a rare slip into her childhood habit.", "qas": [{"answers":

Bartons and the Wilsons, two working-class families. John Barton is a questioner of the distribution of wealth and the relations between rich and poor. Soon his wife dies\u00e2\u0080\u0094he blames it on her grief over the disappearance of her sister Esther. Having already lost his son Tom at a young age, Barton is left to raise his daughter, Mary, alone and now falls into depression and begins to involve himself in the Chartist, trade-union movement.\nChapter 1 takes place in countryside where Moss Side is now.\nMary takes up work at a dressmaker's (her father having objected to her working in a factory) and becomes subject to the affections of hard-working Jem Wilson and Harry Carson, son of a wealthy mill owner. She fondly hopes, by marrying Carson, to secure a comfortable life for herself and her father, but immediately after refusing Jem's offer of marriage she realises that she truly loves him. She therefore decides to evade Carson, planning to show her feelings to Jem in the course of time. Jem believes her decision to be final, though this does not change his feelings for her.\nMeanwhile, Esther, a \"street-walker,\" returns to warn John Barton that he must save Mary from becoming like her. He simply pushes her away, however, and she's sent to jail for a month on the charge of vagrancy. Upon her release she talks to Jem with the same purpose. He promises that he will protect Mary and confronts Carson, eventually entering into a fight with him, which is witnessed by a policeman passing by.\nNot long afterwards, Carson is shot dead, and Jem is arrested for the crime, his gun having been found at the scene. Esther decides to investigate the matter further and discovers that the wadding for the gun was a piece of paper on which is written Mary's name.\nShe visits her niece to warn her to save the one she loves, and after she leaves Mary realises that the murderer is not Jem but her father. She is now faced with having to save her lover without giving away her father. With the help of Job Legh (the intelligent grandfather of her blind friend Margaret), Mary travels to Liverpool to find the only person who could provide an alibi for Jem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Will Wilson, Jem's cousin and a sailor, who was with him on the night of the murder. Unfortunately, Will's ship is already departing, so that, after Mary chases after the ship in a small boat, the only thing Will can do is promise to return in the pilot ship and testify the next day.\nDuring the trial, Jem learns of Mary's great love for him. Will arrives in court to testify, and Jem is found \"not guilty\". Mary has fallen ill during the trial and is nursed by Mr Sturgis, an old sailor, and his wife. When she finally returns to Manchester she has to face her father, who is crushed by his remorse. He summons John Carson, Harry's father, to confess to him that he is the murderer. Carson is still set on justice, but after turning to the Bible he forgives Barton, who dies soon afterwards in Carson's arms. Not long after this Esther comes back to Mary's home, where she, too, soon dies.\nJem decides to leave England, where, his reputation damaged, it would be difficult for him to find a new job.

An angry poltergeist terrorizes Sethe and her three children, causing her two sons to run away forever. Eight years later, Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) lives alone with her daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise). Paul D. (Danny Glover), an old friend from Sweet Home, the plantation Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean, mentally handicapped young woman (Thandie Newton) named Beloved stumbles into Sethe's yard and also stays with them.\nDenver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's reincarnated daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and proceeds to assault him sexually. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead tells what has happened to a co-worker, Stamp Paid (Albert Hall). Stamp Paid, who has known Sethe for many years, pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.\nYears ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews whip Sethe. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle (Hill Harper) Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her and forcibly took her breast milk.\nWhen Halle failed to comply, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slits her older daughter's throat, and attempts to kill her other children. Stamp Paid manages to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departs.\nPaul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work. Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.\nAfter Denver attains employment, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an exorcism. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.\nSome months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her \"best thing\", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A poltergeist"}], "question": "What terrorizes Sethe and her family?",

addressing specific topics that Froude brings. Thomas begins the preface by attacking the overarching claims that Froude uses to argue against self-governance. Thomas ridicules Froude's assertion that if blacks in West Indian countries were given the right to vote, they would elect a candidate that would strip away the rights of whites due to racial animosity. He also attacks the notion that West Indian blacks harbor animosity against whites by pointing out that as many blacks owned slaves as whites, and that most people who were alive during slavery have since died.\nIn Book I Thomas addresses Froude's claims in the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations about the condition of blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.\nIn Book II Thomas begins to directly address Froude's criticism of giving colonies self-rule. When Froude claims that leaders of the reform movements \"did not complain that their affairs had been ill-managed\" Thomas spends over two dozen pages detailing the gross abuses of power and corruption that many of the appointed governors of Trinidad have participated in. Thomas also debunks Froude's claim that the reformers pushed for reform in the hope that they would be elected and allowed to draw a handsome government salary. Thomas also points out that contrary to Froude's claims the reform movement has been active for decades. Thomas finishes the second book by refuting Froude's assertion that West Indian blacks were incredibly well taken care off by \"the beneficent despotism of the English Government\"\nThe 3rd book takes up half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging that there are few black intellectuals. Thomas responds by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society. Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery. Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings up the old stereotypes of blacks being lazy, or being cannibals or devil-worshipers, Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of Christianity among blacks, and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion.\nIn the final 4th book, Thomas discusses the history of blacks instead of analyzing The English in the West Indies. Thomas discusses the history of the development slavery in America and in the West Indies. Thomas details how slave owners in the West Indies became god-parents to their slaves through the Catholic Church, and through this process developed personal relationships with slaves devoid of cruelty.

Thelma is married to a controlling man, Darryl (Christopher McDonald), while Louise works as a waitress in a diner, and is dating a musician who spends most of his time on the road. They head out in Louise's 1966 Ford Thunderbird convertible.\nThey stop for a drink at a roadhouse where Thelma meets and dances with Harlan Puckett (Timothy Carhart). Thelma starts to feel sick, so Harlan takes her outside into the parking lot to get some fresh air. He starts kissing her and taking her clothes off. Thelma resists, but Harlan slaps her and begins to rape her. Louise finds them and threatens to shoot Harlan with a gun that Thelma brought with her. Harlan stops, but as the women walk away, he yells profanities and insults them. Louise responds by killing him. Thelma wants to go to the police, but Louise says that because Thelma was drunk and had been dancing with Harlan, no one would believe her claim of attempted rape. Afraid that she will be prosecuted, Louise decides to go on the run and Thelma accompanies her.\nLouise is determined to travel from Oklahoma to Mexico, but refuses to go through Texas. Something happened to her in Texas years earlier, but she refuses to say exactly what. Heading west, they come across an attractive young man named J.D. (Brad Pitt), and Thelma convinces Louise to let him hitch a ride with them. Louise contacts her boyfriend Jimmy Lennox (Michael Madsen) and asks him to wire transfer her life savings to her. When she goes to pick up the money, she finds that Jimmy has come to see her to deliver the money in person. Thelma invites J.D. into her room and learns he is a thief who has broken parole. They sleep together, and J.D. describes how he conducted his hold-ups. At the same time, Jimmy asks Louise to marry him, but she declines.\nIn the morning, Thelma tells Louise about her night with J.D. When they return to the motel room, they discover J.D. has stolen Louise's life savings and fled. Louise is distraught and frozen with indecision, so the guilty Thelma takes charge and robs a convenience store using the tactics she learned from listening to J.D. Meanwhile, the FBI are getting closer to catching the fugitives, after questioning J.D. and Jimmy, and tapping the phone line at Darryl's house. Arkansas State Police Investigator Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel) discovers that Louise had been raped years earlier in Texas. During a couple of brief phone conversations with her, he expresses sympathy for her predicament and pledges to protect her, but he is unsuccessful in his attempts to persuade her to surrender.\nWhen they are pulled over by a New Mexico state trooper (Jason Beghe), Thelma holds him at gunpoint and locks him in the trunk of his car, while Louise takes his gun and ammunition. They then encounter a truck driver (Marco St. John) who repeatedly makes obscene gestures at them. They pull over and demand his apology, but when he refuses, they fire at the fuel tanker he is driving, causing it to explode. Leaving the man furious (and stealing his hat), they drive off.\nThelma and Louise are finally cornered by the authorities only one hundred yards (91\u00c2\u00a0m) from the edge of the Grand Canyon. Hal arrives on the scene, but he is refused the chance to make one last attempt to talk the women into surrendering themselves. Rather than be captured and spend the rest of their lives in jail, Thelma proposes that they \"keep going\" (over the cliff). Louise asks Thelma if she is certain, and Thelma says yes. They kiss, Louise steps on the accelerator, and they ride the car over the cliff to their presumed deaths.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Two days"}], "question": "How long was the vacation Thelma and Louise took supposed to last?", "id": "dfea98678342e17dbfce44c7906602788cc2267c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Halan attempted to rape Thelma and shouted profanities at them.

But for a time Elisabeth is attracted to a young officer who wishes to marry her. The old love for Salve prevails, however, and Elisabeth spurns the officer, but Salve has already left his native land in desperation and is sailing toward foreign shores. When he finally, after some years, returns to his old home, he finds that Elisabeth, after all, has been true to him. He marries her.\nIt would seem that all is well, but such is not the case.

The computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley, the young girl Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop; all four are in cryonic stasis. Scans of the crew's cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the members. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by male inmates with histories of physical and sexual violence. Inmates recover the pod and its passengers.\nRipley is awakened by Clemens, the prison doctor, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt, he asks what they are looking for in the body of a girl who had obviously drowned. Ripley tells him that they are investigating a possible case of cholera, while secretly fearing that Newt has been impregnated with an alien embryo. Clemens firmly responds by stating that there hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years. The autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. A funeral is held for Newt and Hicks and their bodies are cremated in the facility furnace. In another section of the prison, an alien bursts out of Spike's chest. The Alien kills several members of the colony and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his deranged state. Ripley re-activates Bishop, who confirms that an Alien came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. Ripley informs Andrews of her encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story, but explains that the facility has no weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\nThe Alien surprises Ripley and Clemens in the prison infirmary and kills Clemens. It examines Ripley, but spares her and retreats. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but he is ambushed and killed by the Alien. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien. However, the Alien's intervention causes an explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley, who has not been feeling well this whole time, scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the Queen embryo and the adult Alien into biological weapon.\nDeducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first. They form a plan to lure the creature into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten lead. The bait-and-chase plan results in the death of every prisoner except Morse and Dillon. Dillon remains in the mold to distract the Alien, allowing it to tear him apart as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. The Alien is covered in molten metal but escapes the mold; Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, causing the Alien's exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter, killing it.\nThe Weyland\u00e2\u0080\u0093Yutani commando team arrives, including a man who looks identical to Bishop and explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Knowing he is lying, Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland\u00e2\u0080\u0093Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in a late effort to stop him; Aaron strikes the man with a wrench and is shot dead. The commando team begs Ripley to let them have the \"magnificent specimen\" with no success. Ripley throws herself into the furnace, just as the baby Alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest. Ripley grabs it to prevent it from escaping as they both fall into the furnace to their deaths. The facility is closed and the only surviving inmate, Morse, is led away.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "ELLEN RIPLEY, NEWT, HICKS, AND BISHIO, THE DAMAGED ANDROID."}], "question": "WHO WERE THE 4 MEMBERS IN THE ESCAPE POD?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THAT SHE IS THE ONLY SURVIVOR"}], "question": "WHAT DOES RIPLEY DISCOVER AFTER CRASH-LANDING ON FLORINA?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "SHE IS INVESTIGATING A CASE OF CHOLERA, AND IS ALSO WORRIED SHE MAY HAVE BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH AN ALIEN EMBRYO."}], "question": "WHY DOES RIPLEY ORDER AN AUTOPSY ON NEWT?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "AN ALIEN BURSTS OUT OF SPIKE'S CHESt. "}], "question": "HOW DOES THE ALIEN FIRST COME INTO THE STORY?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THAT SHE IS CARRYING THE EMBRYO OF AN ALIEN QUEEN."}], "question": "WHAT DOES RIPLEY FIND WHEN SHE SCANS HERSELF WITH THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THEY PLAN TO USE THE ADULT ALIEN AND THE ALIEN EMBRYO AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON"}], "question": "WHY DOES THE WEYLAND-YUTANI CORPORATION REALLY SEND THE RESCUE SHIP?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "RIPLEY ASKS DILLON TO KILL HER; HE ONLY AGREES IF SHE WILL HELP THE INMATES KILL THE ALIEN."}], "question": "WHAT AGREEMENT DO DILLON AND RIPLEY COME TO?", "id": "e1ac7a600860a99c208b96dccc4e4f870c3108cf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "THEY TRY TO LURE THE ALIEN INTO THE FOUNDRY'S MOLDING FACILITY, TRAP IT, AND DROWN IT IN MOLTEN LEAD.

Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a professional sex surrogate. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings.\nOne day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets Susan Fernbach, a young woman with whom the audience senses he will finally find happiness. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl.

Though the novel questions the assumptions and morals of 1870s New York society, it never develops into an outright condemnation of the institution.The novel is noted for Wharton's attention to detail and its accurate portrayal of how the 19th-century East Coast American upper class lived, and the social tragedy of its plot. Wharton was 58 years old at publication; she had lived in that world and had seen it change dramatically by the end of World War I.\nThe title is an ironic comment on the polished outward manners of New York society when compared to its inward machinations. It is believed to have been drawn from the popular 1785 painting A Little Girl by Sir Joshua Reynolds that later became known as The Age of Innocence and was widely reproduced as the commercial face of childhood in the later half of the 18th century. The title, while ironic, was not as caustic as the title of story featured in the The House of Mirth, published in 1905.Newland Archer, gentleman lawyer and heir to one of New York City's best families, is happily anticipating a highly desirable marriage to the sheltered and beautiful May Welland. Yet he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's exotic and beautiful 30-year-old cousin. Ellen has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a bad marriage to a Polish count. At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential taint on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturb Newland, but he becomes intrigued by the worldly Ellen, who flouts New York society's fastidious rules. As Newland's admiration for the countess grows, so does his doubt about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; his match with May no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined.\nEllen's decision to divorce Count Olenski causes a social crisis for the other members of her family, who are terrified of scandal and disgrace. Living apart can be tolerated, but divorce is unacceptable. To save the Welland family's reputation, a law partner of Newland asks him to dissuade Countess Olenska from divorcing the count. He succeeds, but in the process comes to care for her; afraid of falling in love with Ellen, Newland begs May to accelerate their wedding date, but she refuses.\nNewland tells Ellen he loves her; Ellen corresponds, but is horrified that their love will aggrieve May. She agrees to remain in America, separated but still married to Count Olenski, only if they do not sexually consummate their love. Newland receives May's telegram agreeing to wed sooner.\nNewland and May marry. He tries unsuccessfully to forget Ellen. His society marriage is loveless, and the social life he once found absorbing has become empty and joyless. Though Ellen lives in Washington and has remained distant, he is unable to cease loving her. Their paths cross while he and May are in Newport, Rhode Island. Newland discovers that Count Olenski wishes Ellen to return to him, but she has refused, although her family wants her to reconcile with her husband and return to Europe. Frustrated by her independence, the family has cut off her money, as the count had already done.\nNewland desperately seeks a way to leave May and be with Ellen, obsessed with how to finally possess her. Despairing of ever making Ellen his wife, he urges her to become his mistress. Then Ellen is recalled to New York City to care for her sick grandmother, who accepts her decision to remain separated and agrees to reinstate her allowance.\nBack in New York and under renewed pressure from Newland, Ellen relents and agrees to consummate their relationship. However, Newland then discovers that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. Newland makes up his mind to abandon May and follow Ellen to Europe when May announces that she and Newland are throwing a farewell party for Ellen. That night, after the party, Newland resolves to tell May he is leaving her for Ellen. She interrupts him to tell him that she learned that morning that she is pregnant; she reveals that she had told Ellen of her pregnancy two weeks earlier, despite not being sure of it at the time. The implication is that she did so because she suspected the affair. Newland guesses that this is Ellen's reason for returning to Europe. Hopelessly trapped, Newland decides not to follow Ellen, surrendering his love for the sake of his children, remaining in a loveless marriage to May.\nTwenty-six years later, after May's death, Newland and his son are in Paris. The son, learning that his mother's cousin lives there, has arranged to visit Ellen in her Paris apartment. Newland is stunned at the prospect of seeing Ellen again. On arriving outside the apartment building, Newland sends up his son alone to meet Ellen, while he waits outside, watching the balcony of her apartment. Newland considers going up, but in the end decides not to; he walks back to his hotel without seeing her.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "May Welland"}], "question": "Who does Newland Archer marry?", "id": "e2ad3b91abda132c04c65f7b93559d2ff23b1cac"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ellen Olenska"}], "question": "Who does Newland meet that leaves him questioning his marriage?", "id": "e2ad3b91abda132c04c65f7b93559d2ff23b1cac"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Thirty years old"}], "question": "How old is Ellen when Newland meets her?", "id": "e2ad3b91abda132c04c65f7b93559d2ff23b1cac"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are cousins"}], "question": "How are Ellen and May related to each other?

He confronts K, who is with his partner Agent J, telling him he is \"already dead\". J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the \"ArcNet\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction.\nBoris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency's records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J's claims. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to The Factory, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but he later captures him. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives and they team up.\nUpon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral, Florida and attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket so it can be deployed in space, J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K, who initially takes the news badly. The three fly there using jetpacks, and are stopped by military police. Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, convincing him of the importance of their mission, and the officer then assists them in reaching the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket's launch tower, they are attacked by both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris. Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boris's left arm (which restores the timeline), knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket's exhaust. 1969 Boris then attacks K on the beach, but the colonel pushes K down and out of the way, taking the hit himself instead. K then kills Boris (which 2012 K had regretted not doing) instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonel's young son inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K wipes his memory and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, and that K has actually been watching over him all his life. His mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he thanks K for being his surrogate father. Meanwhile, Griffin observes the moment and is briefly terrified when K almost forgets to tip a waitress, which sets off a chain of events preventing an asteroid from colliding with Earth.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Alien criminal, Boris the animal, a Boglodite."}], "question": "Who escapes a maximum - security prison in 2012?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Agent K."}], "question": "Who left arm was shot off?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To kill Agent K."}], "question": "Why did Boris travel back in time?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To stop Boris and save agent K."}], "question": "Why must J travel back in time?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "J returns to 2012."}], "question": "Who returned to 2012 after his mission was completed?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Boris attacked K In 1969."}], "question": "In what year did Boris attacked K on the beach?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His name was Griffin."}], "question": "What was the alien name?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Coney island."}], "question": "Where did J travel in 1969?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Boris."}], "question": "Who will comment a murder there?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Boris the Animal"}], "question": "Who escapes the maximum security prison in 2012?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Earth"}], "question": "What planet is Agent K found on?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to kill agent K"}], "question": "Why does Boris travel back in time?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Agent K was not present."}], "question": "Why was arcnet not deployed ?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Back in time to 1969"}], "question": "To when does J travel to restore arcnet?", "id": "e2fde9209d27595d3436ec97714d2e8a065721c7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Griffin"}], "question": "What do K and J encounter at the Factory?

A rock formation in a nearby notch is imagined, by many locals and visitors, to resemble the shape and features of a human face:\nThe Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, to precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height. . . .\nThe local folklore of the valley includes a prophecy, alleged to descend from the Native Americans, that at some future date a native son would be born within sight of the notch whose features would resemble the Great Stone Face; and when this face was seen, those who would see him would recognize that he was \"the greatest and noblest personage of his time.\" This prophecy inspires an innocent youngster of the valley, Ernest, who feels within himself the quest to help uncover this hero.\nAs time passes and Ernest grows to manhood, the story from the notch is bruited about the United States, and others are also inspired. Unlike Ernest, the hope of some of them is that they themselves would be the hero of the tale. One by one, they revisit the valley to seek public recognition and acknowledgment of this resemblance. The succession of would-be American heroes forms the body of Hawthorne's narrative. In succession, a merchant of immense wealth, a conquering general, a politician renowned for his skilled oratory, and finally a brilliant writer return to the glen. After enjoying the brief plaudits of their admirers, the four men each reveal themselves to have character flaws that prevent them from fulfilling the conditions of the prophecy. Each of them have slight flaws in their physiognomies, recognized at once by the sensitive Ernest, that serve as foreshadows of their inability to live up to the expectations of their eager friends.\nDuring this string of disappointments, Ernest has become a spry but aged man. He has progressed from being a hill farmer to the position of local lay preacher. The writer, who (in contrast to the first three contestants) frankly acknowledges his failure to fulfill the prophecy, caps his visit to the notch by attending one of Ernest's impromptu sunset sermons. By popular demand, the congregation has asked Ernest to deliver his sacred remarks from a site at the base of the notch where the worshipers can see the Great Stone Face high above.\nHawthorne describes the climax of Ernest's sermon:\nAt that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter, the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression, so imbued with benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible impulse, threw his arms aloft and shouted, 'Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone Face!' Then all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfillled. But Ernest, having finished what he had to say, took the poet's arm, and walked slowly homeward, still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear, bearing a resemblance to the GREAT STONE FACE.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A man would be born that resembled the image portrayed and he would be the \"greatest and noblest personage of his

Jane Craig (Hunter) is a talented, neurotic producer whose life revolves around her work. Jane's best friend and frequent collaborator, Aaron Altman (Brooks), is a gifted writer and reporter ambitious for on-camera exposure who is secretly in love with Jane. Tom Grunick (Hurt), a local news anchorman who until recently was a sports anchorman, is likeable and telegenic, but lacks news experience and knows that he was only hired for his good looks and charm. He is attracted to Jane, although he is also intimidated by her skills and intensity.\nAll three work out of the Washington D.C. office of a national television network. Craig is drawn to Grunick, but resents his lack of qualifications for his new position as news anchor. Altman also is appalled by Grunick's lack of experience and knowledge, but accepts his advice when finally getting an opportunity to anchor a newscast himself. Unfortunately, he lacks Grunick's poise and composure in that seat, and his debut as an anchor is a resounding failure.\nAltman acknowledges to Craig that he is in love with her while trying to dissuade her from pursuing a romantic relationship with Grunick. As a massive layoff hits the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs, Altman tenders his resignation, and tells her he plans to take a job in Portland, Oregon. However, before he leaves, he tips off Craig to a breach of ethics on Grunick's part. She decides she cannot in good conscience get personally involved with Grunick, who the network is transferring to London. She no longer has either man in her personal or professional life, at least until the three of them reunite several years later.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Producer"}], "question": "What is Jane Craig's profession?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aaron Altman"}], "question": "Who is Jane's best friend?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jane"}], "question": "Who does Aaron secretly love?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Writer and Producer"}], "question": "What does Aaron do for a living?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "local news anchorman"}], "question": "What does Tom do for a living?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Washington, DC"}], "question": "What city does Tom, Jane, and Aaron work out of?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A national television network"}], "question": "Who do Tom, Jane, an Aaron work for?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aaron"}], "question": "Who acknowledges their love to Jane?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tom"}], "question": "Who got promoted mainly because of their good looks?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tom"}], "question": "Who gets transferred to London?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jane Craig"}], "question": "Who character is considered neurotic?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aaron Altman"}], "question": "Who is Jane's best friend?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tom Grunick"}], "question": "Which character used to be a sports anchorman?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jane Craig"}], "question": "Which character is Tom attracted to?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Aaron Altman"}], "question": "Which character is secretly in love with Jane?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Washington D.C."}], "question": "What city do all three character work in?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Altman"}], "question": "Whose debut as an anchorman is a failure?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Altman"}], "question": "Which character tenders his resignation?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Grunick"}], "question": "Which character is getting transfered to London?", "id": "e46daf966d764e1ef9d880884efa3b17a636e65d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Layoffs"}], "question": "What is the cause of people at the network losing their jobs?

She is selected to go to a ball to repair torn dresses. At the ball she meets the aristocratic Henry Bellingham, a rake figure who is instantly attracted to her. They meet again by chance and form a secret friendship; on an outing together they are spotted by Mrs Mason who, fearing for her shop's reputation, dismisses Ruth.\nAlone in the world, Ruth is whisked away by Bellingham to London where it is implied she becomes a fallen woman. They go on holiday to Wales together and there on a country walk Ruth meets the disabled and kind Mr Benson. Bellingham falls sick with fever and the hotel calls for his mother who arrives and is disgusted by her son's having lived in sin with Ruth. Bellingham is persuaded by his mother to abandon Ruth in Wales, leaving her some money.\nA distraught Ruth attempts suicide but is spotted by Mr Benson who helps comfort her. When he learns of her past and that she is alone he brings her back to his home town, where he is a Dissenting minister, to stay with him and his formidable but kind sister Faith. When they learn that Ruth is pregnant they decide to lie to the town and claim that she is a widow called Mrs Denbigh, to protect her from a society which would otherwise shun her.\nRuth has her baby, whom she names Leonard. She is transformed into a Madonna type figure, calm and innocent once more. The rich local businessman Mr Bradshaw admires Ruth and employs her as a governess for his children, including his eldest daughter Jemima who is in awe of the beautiful Ruth.\nRuth goes away with the Bradshaws to a seaside house while one of Mr Bradshaw's children is convalescing from a long illness. Mr Bradshaw brings Mr Donne, a man whom he is sponsoring to become their local MP, to the seaside to impress him. Ruth recognises Mr Donne as actually being Mr Bellingham and the two have a confrontation on the beach. Bellingham offers to marry Ruth as he claims he still loves her and for the sake of their child, Ruth rejects him saying she will not let Leonard come in contact with a man like him.\nFrom local gossip Jemima discovers about Ruth's past, though she is still unaware that it was Mr Donne who is Leonard's father. Jemima is headstrong and already jealous that her suitor Mr Farquhar, her father's business partner, seems to admire Ruth over her. The truth is Mr Farquhar is put off by Jemima's erratic behaviour, caused by her father's good intentioned interference. Jemima however decides to keep quiet over Ruth's past as she realises that she comes from a more privileged background and the same could well have happened to her, had she been in Ruth's situation.\nMr Bradshaw discovers also from local gossip however that Ruth is a fallen woman and despite Jemima's passionate defence of Ruth she is thrown out of the house and sacked. Ruth goes home and has to reveal to Leonard that he is in fact illegitimate; he is devastated and ashamed by the news. Mr Bradshaw also goes to his old friend Mr Benson and argues with him as he allowed the lie to be told and for Ruth to enter not only his but also Mr Bradshaw's house.\nJemima and Mr Farquhar marry and have their own child and form a good friendship with Ruth and Leonard but they are still on the outskirts of society. Ruth goes among the poor to work as a nurse to the sick and gains a good reputation there, making Leonard proud of his mother once more and restoring their relationship. Mr Bradshaw's son is found to have been embezzling the company's funds and his father disowns him. However, when his son is later involved in an accident, Mr Bradshaw is distraught and realises that his morals had been perhaps too heavy-handed in the past. His son recovers and Mr Bradshaw starts to rethink his life.\nRuth has to give up her work as there is a catching fever in the environment. A local doctor offers to sponsor Leonard's studies at a good school and the Farquhars offer to go away on holiday with Ruth and Leonard. However before Ruth has made a decision she hears that Mr Donne is very sick; she confides in the doctor the truth about who Mr Donne really is, and goes to him. He is delirious with fever and does not recognise her but she nurses him back to health.\nRuth however falls sick and dies from the illness. At the funeral many of the poor that Ruth had looked after praise her, and the chapel is full of people that loved Ruth, despite her being a fallen woman. Mr Donne comes to Mr Benson's house and sees Ruth dead, he is momentarily sad and offers money to Mr Benson who realises who he must be and throws him out of the house.\nThe novel ends with Mr Bradshaw finding a weeping Leonard at his mother's grave, whom he leads home to Mr Benson, and reforming his friendship with Mr Benson realising that as a member of the society that ostracised Ruth, he is also responsible for her death.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ruth contracts an illness while helping Mr. Donne get well."}], "question": "How does Ruth die?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Bradshaw"}], "question": "Whose son gets caught embezzling corporate funds?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To repair dresses"}], "question": "Why is Ruth going to the ball?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bellingham becomes sick with fever."}], "question": "Why does the hotel cal Bellingham's mther?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jemima"}], "question": "Who is jealous because her suitor admire's Ruth?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "governance"}], "question": "What job does Mr. Bradshaw offer to Ruth?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Leonard"}], "question": "What does Ruth name her baby?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is really Bellingham."}], "question": "When introduced to Mr. Donne, what does Ruth notice about him?", "id": "e524c75271fe0e5c4b1fdbc3c2e297cdecf1b113"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "marry Ruth"}], "question": "During the confrontation with Ruth, what does Bellingham offer to do for the sake of their child?

The residents include the law student Eug\u00e8ne de Rastignac, a mysterious agitator named Vautrin, and an elderly retired vermicelli-maker named Jean-Joachim Goriot. The old man is ridiculed frequently by the other boarders, who soon learn that he has bankrupted himself to support his two well-married daughters.\nRastignac, who moved to Paris from the south of France, becomes attracted to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beaus\u00e9ant, in the ways of high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.\nRastignac refuses to go along with the plot, balking at the idea of having someone killed to acquire their wealth, but he takes note of Vautrin's machinations. This is a lesson in the harsh realities of high society. Before long, the boarders learn that police are seeking Vautrin, revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort (\"Cheater of Death\"). Vautrin arranges for a friend to kill Victorine's brother, in the meantime, and is captured by the police.\nGoriot, supportive of Rastignac's interest in his daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him that she has been selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke.\nDelphine does not visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once he has lost consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is attended only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners.

A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, devouring the skier while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.\nAlong with these disappearances, a killer whale bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody believes these events are the work of a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who doubts the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds debris from the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.\nThe following day, at the beach, Brody sees a dark shadow that approaches the swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone out of the water and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish, making people think Brody's insane. His fears are later confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and vote Brody out as Police Chief.\nThe next morning, Brody's teenage son Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing with his friends after his love interest Jackie Peters goads him to, but his younger brother Sean catches him and encourages Mike to bring him along. After an argument at the dock, Marge, one of Mike's friends, playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her, and after a couple other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after going underwater, one of the divers encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits teenagers Tina Wilcox and Eddie Marchand; Eddie falls in the water and is killed by the shark.\nBrody and his wife Ellen follow an ambulance to the docks, where they find Tom as he is put on a stretcher; the divers suspect something scared him underwater. Deputy Len Hendricks, Brody's replacement, tells them Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody, along with Ellen and Hendricks, takes the police boat to rescue them. While searching, they come across Tina's boat, and find her hiding in the bow; she fearfully mentions the shark's presence. Hendricks and Ellen take Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while Brody goes on to find the kids.\nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the other kids, hitting one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize and crash into each other in the ensuing panic, throwing several of them, including Mike and Sean, in the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.\nBrody runs into Mike, who tells his father that Sean is with his friends, drifting towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for not knowing about the shark. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark reappears, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its corpse sinks to the bottom of the sea. The shaken kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are photographing the wreck of

introduced as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is a carefree popular mean girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature and sharp-tongued remarks.\nAfter several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (Paul Reubens). Two young men, Oliver Pike (Luke Perry), and best friend Benny (David Arquette), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him. Not only this, but a studious girl from Buffy's class, Cassandra, is abducted one night by Amilyn and sacrificed to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.\nWhen Pike realizes there is something wrong with Benny and that he is no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his tribe of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn flees the fight to talk to Lothos. After this encounter, Buffy and Pike start a friendship, which eventually becomes romantic and Pike becomes Buffy's partner in fighting the undead.\nDuring a basketball game, Buffy finds out that one of the players, and a friend of Jeffrey's, is a vampire. After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy finally confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. Lothos puts Buffy in a hypnotic trance, which is broken due to Merrick's intervention. Lothos turns on Merrick and impales him with the stake he attempted to use on him. Lothos leaves, saying that Buffy is not ready. As Merrick dies, he tells Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by the rules of others and he says \"remember about the music.\" Because of her new life, responsibilities, and heartbreak, Buffy becomes emotionally shocked and starts dropping her Slayer duties. When she arrives at school, she attempts to explain everything to her friends, but they refuse to understand her as they are more concerned with their upcoming school dance, and Buffy falls out with them as she realizes she is outgrowing their immature, selfish behavior.\nAt the senior dance, Buffy tries to patch things up with her friends but they turn against her, and she is dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for one of her friends. However, she meets up with Pike and as they start to dance and kiss, Lothos leads the remainder of his minions to the school and attacks the students and the attending faculty. Buffy confronts the vampires outside while Pike fights the vampiric Benny. After overpowering the vampires, she confronts Lothos inside the school and kills Amilyn. Lothos hypnotizes Buffy again and when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and is ready to defend herself and fight. Lothos ignites her cross but she uses hairspray to create a makeshift flame-thrower and burns him before escaping back into the gym. Buffy sees everybody recover from the attack, but Lothos emerges again getting into a fight with Buffy, who then stakes him.\nAs all of the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance.

As she leaves, Charlie pushes a note into her hand. She reads that it says he will be in their old meeting place at eight o' clock. She meets him in a garden. After some playful conversation, Charlie introduces her to her first sexual experience. Father Ambrose, who had been hiding in the shrubs, surprises them afterward, scolding both of them for their behaviour and threatening to reveal what they have been doing to their guardians. Bella pleads for mercy. Father Ambrose, appearing to relent, tells Bella to meet him in the sacristy at two o'clock the next day and Charlie to meet him at the same time the day after that. Ambrose instructs Bella into a way she may be absolved of her sins and blackmails her into sex with him, lest he tell her guardian what she was up to. Then Ambrose's colleagues, the Fr Superior & Fr Clement, catch them in the act, and they demand equal rights to Bella's favours. And so Bella is introduced to serving the Holy community in a special way.\nDespite his promises, Ambrose goes to see Bella's uncle, Monsieur Verbouc and tells of her lewd behaviour. This leads to her uncle, who has long entertained lustful thoughts of his niece, attempting to force himself on Bella. The narrator then intervenes, biting him to put a damper on his ardour.\nNext, Father Clement, looking for Bella's room, climbs into the window of Bella's aunt, the pious Madame Verbouc, who had mistaken him for her husband. M. Verbouc then bursts in and his wife realises she's actually been making love to the randy priest.\nBella's friend, Julia Delmont, becomes Ambrose's next target. By now completely corrupted and happy to go along with whatever Ambrose suggests, Bella readily agrees to the Father's next scheme: She will offer herself to Monsieur Delmont, on condition that her face is covered. The trick is that it will not be Bella who lies there, but Delmont's own daughter. Father Ambrose seduces her and says he will come to her by night and make love to her, but she must hide her face.\nWhen the act is consummated, Bella appears and pretends that it was all a big mistake. But since Delmont has now potentially impregnated his daughter, the only way to be sure his incest cannot be discovered is to have all make love to her as well. In case she is pregnant, nobody can claim that her own father is the father.\nBella and Julia eventually become nuns, and the book ends as they participate in an orgy with 19 priests.", "qas":

The central planets formed the Alliance and won a war against the outer planet Independents\u00e2\u0080\u0094those refusing to join the Alliance. River Tam (Summer Glau) is coercively conditioned by Alliance scientists into a psychic assassin. She is rescued by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several officers and learned top government secrets. Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is tasked with recapturing her.\nThe siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship Serenity with Captain Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), first mate Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne (Alan Tudyk), mercenary Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin), and mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite). Despite Simon's objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery where they are attacked by savage and cannibalistic Reavers. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave Serenity at the next port. Once there, however, a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive hacker Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz), who discovers a subliminal message designed to trigger River's mental conditioning. He notes River whispered \"Miranda\" before attacking and warns that someone else saw the footage.\nMal is invited to visit Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a former Serenity occupant. Despite knowing she is held hostage as a trap, Mal goes to rescue her. The Operative confronts Mal, promising to let him go free if he turns over River. Mal refuses and escapes with Inara. River reveals that Miranda is a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers. The crew flies to the planet Haven to ponder their next move. They find Haven devastated and their old friend, Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), mortally wounded. The Operative claims responsibility for the killings. He promises to keep pursuing them and killing anyone who assists them until he captures River.\nDespite the crew's objection, Mal disguises Serenity as a Reaver ship and travels to Miranda. On the planet, the crew find all its colonists dead and a recording by the last surviving member of an Alliance survey team (Sarah Paulson). She explains that an experimental chemical designed to suppress aggression was added into Miranda's air. Most residents became so docile they stopped performing all activities of daily living and allowed themselves to die. A small portion of the population had the opposite reaction and became exceedingly aggressive and violent, turning into Reavers.\nMr. Universe agrees to broadcast the recording, luring the crew to the Operative. However, the Operative mortally wounds him, destroys his transmitting equipment, and prepares an ambush. Though Mal suspects a trap, he must deliver broadcast the recording. On the way, they provoke the Reaver fleet into pursuing them. While the Reaver fleet clashes with the waiting Alliance fleet, Serenity crash lands near the broadcast tower. Wash is killed by Reavers shortly after.\nThe crew make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to broadcast the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon, prompting River to dive through the doors and close them as the Reavers drag her away. At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops reach the group, but the Operative orders them to stand down.\nThe Operative provides medical aid and resources to repair Serenity.

The Passionate Friends is written as if addressed to Stephen's eldest son, who is on the verge of adolescence. Stephen is the only child of a rector who loses his faith due to Darwinism.\nThe most important relationship of Stephen's life is with the Lady Mary Christian (later Lady Mary Justin), a beautiful blue-eyed contemporary who has been his childhood \"playmate\" and with whom he falls deeply in love at the age of nineteen during the summer before he begins his studies at Oxford. Mary returns his love, but will not promise to marry Stephen. Having resolved to \"belong to myself,\" Mary weds Justin, a wealthy financier, but intends also to remain Stephen's intimate friend.\nStephen cannot accept this, breaks off relations, and experiences despair. In an attempt to put his troubles behind him, Stephen volunteers to fight in South Africa, where the Second Boer War has just begun (1899). He becomes an officer and distinguishes himself in the fighting, and also is exposed for the first time to \"the social fundamental of Labor.\" Back in England he decides to pursue a political career, since his father has unexpectedly inherited a substantial fortune. But by chance his father is now living on a property adjacent to Lady Mary Justin's; they meet and become lovers.\nStephen had begun to court another near neighbor, Rachel, but the resumption of his passionate relationship with Mary suspends this project. Disaster strikes when Justin sees Stephen kiss his wife. In the following crisis the powerful Justin hides Mary away in an Irish castle and prevails upon Stephen to leave England for a period of three years.\nTraveling the world, Stephen studies Asian societies and develops convictions about the historical development of humanity. He believes that \"Civilization has never yet existed, it has only continually and obstinately attempted to be. Our Civilization is but the indistinct twilight before the dawn.\" He resolves to devote himself to \"the making of a new world-city, a new greater State above your legal States, in which all human life becomes a splendid enterprise, free and beautiful.\" In a villa on the Rhine he chances to meet Rachel again, and after a trip to America he asks her to become his wife; they are married on Nov. 8, 1906. Stephen undertakes with a progressive American named Giddings a career as a publisher of world literature and reference books.\nHis work is going well when in 1909 Stephen receives a letter from Lady Mary Justin. She asks him to resume writing to her, and over a period of two years challenges him to integrate the problem of sex into his world-historical reflections and plans, warning that \"All this great world-state of your man's imagination is going to be wrecked by us if you ignore us, we women are going to be the Goths and Huns of another Decline and Fall.\" Their correspondence addresses personal as well as religious and political matters, but they have no intention of seeing each other again.\nHowever, by chance they do meet again at an inn in the Alps on Engstlen Lake, below Titlis, and share several hours of spiritual communing; they scarcely touch and never kiss. Stephen leaves promptly. But Mary's companion betrays her to husband, whose decision to divorce Mary after a trial for adultery threatens them both with social disaster. In order to forestall this, Mary commits suicide. In his final remarks to his son, Stephen Stratton judges Mary to have been a victim \"caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions.\" He resolves, in the novel's final sentence: \"I give myself, and if I can I will give you, to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters and instruments of jealousy, both in my own self and in the thought and laws and usage of the world.\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Darwinism"}], "question": "What causes Stephen to lose his faith?", "id":

girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood.\nIt is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector.\nThe montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of Viggi\u00f9 after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines.\nAbout a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help \u2014 advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with film, using a home movie camera, and he has met, and captured on film, Elena, daughter of a wealthy banker. Salvatore woos \u2014 and wins \u2014 Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval.\nAs Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service. His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves town to pursue his future, as a filmmaker.\nSalvatore has obeyed Alfredo, but he returns home to attend the funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo's widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore's successes with pride, and he left him something \u2014 an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist.\nSalvatore returns to Rome. He watches Alfredo's reel and discovers that it comprises a very special montage. It contains all of the romantic scenes the priest had ordered cut from movies; Alfredo had spliced the sequences together to form a single film. Salvatore has made peace with his past.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Elena"}], "question": "Who was Salvadore's High School sweetheart?", "id":

it starts off with a scene in South Sudan, where the LRA are attacking a village. This opening scene is placed into context later in the film. Childers was an alcoholic drug-using biker from Pennsylvania. On his release from prison, he finds that his wife has given up her job as a stripper, because she has since accepted Christ as her savior. One night he almost kills a vagrant. However, the day after that night, his wife persuades him to go to church with her, where he is eventually baptized and offered salvation.\nHe finds a stable job as a construction worker and later starts his own construction gig. Later, on a missionary trip to Uganda to build homes for refugees, he asks one of the SPLA soldiers watching over them to take him on a trip to the north, to Sudan. The soldier warns him that it is a war zone, but upon Sam's insistence they go. They arrive at a medical tent in Sudan. As the soldier moved off to talk to some people, Sam is roped in by a female doctor to help lift a lipless Sudanese woman onto the examination table. That night as they lay on their beds at the relief station, they hear noises outside, and when they look out, Sam and the soldier see large numbers of Sudanese children swarming in to sleep outside the building.\nThe soldier explains that their parents send them to sleep over there because it is safer than staying in their own village. Sam wakes up the children and gets as many as he can to sleep in their room for the night. The next day they follow the children back to their village only to find that the LRA burnt it down and killed their parents. One of the children runs after his dog and is killed by a hidden landmine. Sam then decides to build an orphanage for the children of South Sudan. After the orphanage is built, the LRA attack it under cover of night and burn it to the ground. Sam then phones home, telling his wife what happened and that he is giving up. She reminds him that the orphans have been through worse but they have not given up, and that he should not give up and tells him to rebuild the orphanage.\nOne night after the orphanage has been rebuilt, he and his friends from the SPLA are attacked on the road by the LRA, they manage to chase off the small force of the LRA that attacked them. They search the area and discover a large group of Sudanese children hiding in a ditch not far from the road. Since they can not take all the children in one trip, Sam chooses to take the ones who need medical attention along with a few others on their first trip back to the orphanage. However, upon returning to the spot as quickly as he could, he finds that the LRA killed and burnt those he had left behind. This causes Childers to lead armed raids to rescue children from the LRA.\nHe returns home disgruntled and exasperated about the lack of money for the project. Meanwhile his friend Donnie dies, this pushes him further into negativity. He sells his business and boards plane for Sudan. His faith and mission revitalises when an orphan boy shares his personal story. The boy tells if Sam allows hatred fester in heart, his fight against injustice fails. Sam rekindles his emotional attachment with his family over phone. Next day he involves with the camp actively. Later he goes out with SPLA and rescues a caravan full of children kidnapped by LRA. The end credits include black and white pictures of the real Sam Childers, his wife, daughter, and his orphanage in Sudan. The pictures are followed by a short black and white home video clip of Sam talking about his work, while the credits roll on the left side of the screen.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sudan"}], "question": "What country did Sam Childers build his orphanage in?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A construction business"}], "question": "What kind of business did Sam start after he became a Christian?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Uganda."}], "question": "What country was Sam's original mission trip to?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To build homes for refugees."}], "question": "What was the purpose of Sam's first mission trip to Africa?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She worked as a stripper."}], "question": "What was Sam's wife's occupation before she became a Christian?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Because it was not safe for them at home."}], "question": "During Sam's first trip to Sudan, why did the children come to the relief center?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He was killed by a land mine."}], "question": "What happened to the boy who was chasing his dog after his parents had been killed?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They were killed by the LRA soldiers."}], "question": "What happened to the children that hid in a ditch who Sam had to leave behind and come back for?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They killed and burned children he was working on rescuing."}], "question": "What event caused Sam Childers to lead armed raids against the LRA?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An SLRA soldier who was watching him."}], "question": "Who first took Sam into Sudan?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "South Sudan"}], "question": "In what location does the LRA first attack a village?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Pennsylvania"}], "question": "Where is Childers from?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is baptized and offered salvation."}], "question": "What happens at church with Childers?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Construction worker"}], "question": "What job does Childers find?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Homes"}], "question": "What does Childers help build for refugees?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A Swarm of Sudanese children "}], "question": "Who do Sam and the soldier see outside the at the relief station building?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Its safer than their own village"}], "question": "Why do the parents send their children over?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The LRA attack and burn it down."}], "question": "What happens to the orphanage after it is built for the first time?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Armed raids on the LRA"}], "question": "What does Childers lead to rescue children?", "id": "ea8a59cfd3bf37630e5601f53765d1abbf9577db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "SPLA"}], "question": "With what group does Childers work with saving children?

The book begins on the wedding-day of his sickly son Conrad and princess Isabella. Shortly before the wedding, however, Conrad is crushed to death by a gigantic helmet that falls on him from above. This inexplicable event is particularly ominous in light of an ancient prophecy, \"that the castle and lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it\". Manfred, terrified that Conrad's death signals the beginning of the end for his line, resolves to avert destruction by marrying Isabella himself while divorcing his current wife Hippolita, who he feels has failed to bear him a proper heir.\nHowever, as Manfred attempts to marry Isabella, she escapes to a church with the aid of a peasant named Theodore. Manfred orders Theodore's death while talking to the friar Jerome, who ensured Isabella's safety in the church. When Theodore removes his shirt to be killed, Jerome recognises a marking below his shoulder and identifies Theodore as his own son. Jerome begs for his son's life, but Manfred says Jerome must either give up the princess or his son's life. They are interrupted by a trumpet and the entrance of knights from another kingdom who want to deliver Isabella. This leads the knights and Manfred to race to find Isabella.\nTheodore, having been locked in a tower by Manfred, is freed by Manfred's daughter Matilda. He races to the underground church and finds Isabella. He hides her in a cave and blocks it to protect her from Manfred and ends up fighting one of the mysterious knights. Theodore badly wounds the knight, who turns out to be Isabella's father, Frederic. With that, they all go up to the castle to work things out. Frederic falls in love with Matilda and he and Manfred begin to make a deal about marrying each other's daughters. Manfred, suspecting that Isabella is meeting Theodore in a tryst in the church, takes a knife into the church, where Matilda is meeting Theodore. Thinking his own daughter is Isabella, he stabs her. Theodore is then revealed to be the true prince of Otranto and Matilda dies, leaving Manfred to repent. Theodore becomes king and eventually marries Isabella because she is the only one who can understand his true sorrow.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Conrad death signal the end of Manfred life."}], "question": "Why was Manfred terrified?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gigantic helmet fell on him."}], "question": "When did Conrad got crushed to death?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Theodore."}], "question": "Who help Isabella escaped to the church?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Order Theodore death."}], "question": "What did Manfred do?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Marking below Theodore shoulder."}], "question": "When did Jerome recognise Theodore was his son?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jerome."}], "question": "Who begged for his son life?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In the tower."}], "question": "Where was Theodore locked?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The knight."}], "question": "Who was badly wound?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Isabella father."}], "question": "Who did the knight turn out to be?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "His wedding"}], "question": "What special day is being held for Conrad?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is crushed to death by a giant helmet"}], "question": "What happens to Conrad?", "id": "eaba6723befdddc5c5177c5c1bf5262d850c2a99"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It was prophecized "}], "question": "How is Conrad's death peculiarly ominous?

General Mitchener is in a state of considerable anxiety about the number of Suffragettes chaining themselves to government buildings. He has had all the railings removed, but is informed by an orderly that another suffragette has padlocked herself to the door scraper. Surprisingly, he has received a letter from the Prime Minister, Balsquith, telling him to release the woman and let her into the building. When he does so, he learns that this suffragette is none other than the Prime Minister himself, disguised as a woman. As he tried to get to the War Office, there were so many suffragettes chasing him that he thought the safest option was to pretend to be one of them. Balsquith informs Mitchener that his arch-rival General Sandstone has resigned from the government, since his plan of creating a male-only exclusion zone of two miles around Westminster has failed. Women are refusing to leave. Mitchener is in favour of the plan, offering Balsquith his usual advice: \"shoot them down\". Balsquith says events are getting out of control. Already a pro-suffrage curate has been flogged by an army lieutenant, who fails to realise that the curate has aunts in the peerage. Britain needs to concentrate on the threat of German rearmament, but is distracted by these domestic issues.\nMitchener says that the solution to the German problem is simple - shoot them down. Balsquith points out that the Germans might shoot back. Mitchener says he's been wanting to invade them for years. Britain needs to think ahead. Soon it may be possible to travel to the moon, and if the Germans get there first there is a real prospect of a \"German moon\". Meanwhile, he suggests that the lieutenant should be flogged in reprisal for his actions, but Balsquith reminds him that the man's father donated a large sum to party funds. He suggests that Mitchener should charm one of the aunts, Lady Richmond, and offer to promote the curate. The General asks his housekeeper Mrs Farrell to find a uniform for him, as he needs to look his best to see Lady Richmond. It should be one befitting a hero who has risked his life in battle. Mrs Farrell says she has risked hers giving birth to eight children; risking life to create more life is better than risking it to destroy the lives of others.\nThe orderly announces that Mrs Banger and Lady Corinthia Fanshawe, leaders of the anti-suffrage movement, have arrived. Balsquith, he says, fled as soon as he saw them. Mitchener is shocked by the orderly's derogatory comments about the Prime Minister, but the orderly tells him that he wouldn't be in the army if it weren't for conscription, and now that he is, he trusts sergeants more than generals. Mitchener orders the orderly to arrest himself for insubordination. Mrs Banger and Lady Corinthia enter. They declare that the men have failed to defeat the suffragettes. New tactics are needed. Mrs Banger says that the suffragettes have got it all wrong. Women don't want to vote, they want to join the army. In fact most great leaders, including Bismarck and Napoleon, were women in disguise. Lady Corinthia, in contrast, believes that women should control men by using feminine glamour and charm. Giving votes to women will ensure that the ugly and dowdy ones will be as powerful as charming beauties such as herself, which is outrageous.\nMitchener is so shocked by the arguments of Mrs Banger and Lady Corinthia that he decides he is now in favour of votes for women. Mrs Banger says she will try to get Sandstone's support. After she leaves Balsquith reappears and says that the government is cracking. The Liberals and the Labour party have declared support for women's suffrage. Mitchener says he must now withdraw his support, since he cannot be seen to bow to pressure. The orderly returns with news that General Sandstone has been forced by Mrs Banger to allow women to join the army. Further, Mrs Banger's tactic of sitting on the general's head until he gives in has so impressed Sandstone that he's proposed marriage to her. Mitchener decides that he will marry the only sensible woman he knows, Mrs Farrell. Mrs Farrell only agrees after consulting her daughter, a variety performer who is engaged to the son of a Duke. Lady Corintha is left with Balsquith, but he insists that he does not wish to marry. She says that she too does not want marriage, which is far too vulgar. She must fulfil her destiny to be his \"Egeria\", or behind-the-scenes advisor. The orderly is promoted to the rank of lieutenant, as he is too incompetent to be a sergeant.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "People are chaining themselves to government

[{"context": " The film is set shortly before Christmas in the North Country of Upstate New York, near the Akwesasne ('Where the Partridge Drums') St. Regis Mohawk Reservation and the border crossing to Cornwall, Ontario. Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) is a discount store clerk struggling to raise two sons with her husband, a compulsive gambler who has disappeared with the funds she had earmarked to finance the purchase of a double-wide mobile home. While searching for him, she encounters Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), a Mohawk bingo-parlor employee who is driving his car, which she claims she found abandoned with the keys in the ignition at the local bus station. The two women, who have both fallen on hard economic times, form a desperate and uneasy alliance and begin trafficking illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States across the frozen St. Lawrence River for $1,200 each.\nRay's older son T.J. wants to find a job and help support the family so they can afford to eat something more substantial than popcorn and Tang. He and his mother clash over whether he should remain in high-school and look after his little brother Ricky or drop out to work. To make matters worse, T.J. sets an outside corner of the trailer afire with a torch in an attempt to unfreeze the water pipe. Lila longs for the day she will be able to reclaim and live with her young son, who was taken from her by her mother-in-law immediately after his birth.\nBecause the women's route takes them from an Indian reservation in the US to an Indian reserve in Canada, they hope to avoid detection by local law-enforcement. However, their problems escalate when they are asked to smuggle a Pakistani couple and Ray, fearful their duffel bag might contain explosives, leaves it behind in sub-freezing temperatures, only to discover it contained their infant baby when they arrive at their destination. She and Lila retrace their route and find the bag and the baby, which Lila insists is dead, but which she revives moments before being reunited with the baby's parents. The experience leaves her shaken, and she announces she no longer wants to participate in the smuggling operation. But Ray, needing just one more crossing to finance the down payment on her mobile home, coerces her into joining her for one last journey.\nThey pick up two Asian women from a strip club for crossing. When the club owner tries to shoot them, Ray successfully threatens him with a gun. When she is re-entering her car, the irate club owner retaliates by shooting Ray in the ear. Shaken, her fast and erratic driving catches the attention of the provincial police. Ray tries to elude capture by crossing the frozen river where one of the wheels of the car breaks through the ice. The four women abandon the vehicle and take refuge at the Indian reservation.\nBecause the police are demanding a scapegoat, the tribal head decides to excommunicate Lila for five years due to her smuggling history which involved the death of her Mohawk husband. Surprised then saddened by the news, Lila gives in to Ray's pleas to go free for the sake of her children. However, running through the woods, Ray has a fit of conscience and returns. She gives her share of money to Lila with instructions for taking care of her sons and seeing through purchase plans for a trailer home. She and the illegal immigrants are surrendered to the police and a trooper speculates she will have to serve four months in jail. She calls her son T.J. to explain what has happened.\nLila pushes her way into her mother-in-law's home and reclaims her infant son. She and the baby show up at the Eddy trailer while T.J. is still on the phone with his jailed mother. In a day scene, T.J. completes the welding of a bicycle-propelled carousel bearing his younger brother and Lila's strapped in baby. He pedals the carousel while Lila smiles on.

III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.\nLongshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace.\nWarned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan (John Murtagh) and Mornay (Alun Armstrong) betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert. Remorseful, he gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child.\nIn London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate (David Gant), tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy,\" and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him. At the same time, Longshanks dies.\nIn 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "his paternal Uncle Argyle"}], "question": "Who

Following their first full sexual experience, zerophiliacs begin to change sex after experiencing an orgasm. Luke (Taylor Handley), a young man somewhat insecure about his masculinity, begins to exhibit zerophilia following an encounter with a woman (Kelly Le Brock). He meets Michelle (Rebecca Mozo) and experiences partial transformations when they go out together.\nHe confides with his best friend Keenan (Dustin Seavey) about his partial transformations, who in turn contacts Dr. Sydney Catchadourian (Gina Bellman). Dr. Catchadourian persuades Luke to go through a full transformation. Luke does this by masturbating, becoming female, and subsequently calling herself \"Luca\". Luca has difficulty achieving an orgasm to change back, even with coaching from Keenan's girlfriend Janine (Alison Folland). However, a visit by Michelle's attractive brother, Max (Kyle Schmid), who flirts with \"Luke's cousin\", enables her to get sufficiently aroused to complete the transformation back to Luke.\nLuke is threatened by his sex transformation, his arousal by an attractive male, and the questions of sexual identity it raises; he seeks help from Sydney. She tells him that a zerophiliac can become \"a-morphic\" and stop changing sex only by having sex with another zerophiliac... such as herself. He reluctantly agrees to do it, but discovers afterward that she was not telling him the full truth: an a-morphic zerophiliac can still change by having sex with another zerophiliac, and Dr. Catchadourian was using Luke to change herself one last time (into a man), leaving Luca as a woman in the process.\nComic tensions arise from Luke's efforts to keep Michelle at a distance, Max's defensiveness about his sister, Luca's half-hearted resistance to Max's affections, and Luke's confused aggression toward Max. When Michelle discovers that Luke had sex with Dr. Catchadourian, she feels betrayed. Hoping to find Michelle, Luca seeks out Max to profess deep affection for Michelle and remorse for betraying her. Max is touched by the apology, and reveals that he is actually Michelle, also a zerophiliac. They make love repeatedly, changing sex mostly in sync with each other, but occasionally finding themselves the same sex. It ends with the happy couple apparently resolved to their 'condition' and past any questions of their sexual identity.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A fictional condition that leads to sexual transformation from one gender to the other.

Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals like adapting Casino Royale in favor of a horror novel called Psycho by Robert Bloch, which is based on the crimes of murderer Ed Gein. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the Psycho story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).\nHitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, Whitfield Cook, to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at Paramount prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to produce the film. (As this film completed his contract with Paramount, all subsequent films were made at Universal.)\nHowever, the pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the Motion Picture Production Code, and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, Janet Leigh, annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair. This concern affects Hitchcock's work on Psycho. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.\nAlma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, but this sequence, which included a complicated process shot showing Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35mm lens, instead of the 50mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film, proved to be the least effective in the film.\nMeanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to Vera Miles at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after Grace Kelly; but Miles says she is happy with her family life.\nHitchcock's cut of Psycho is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma convincing Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding Bernard Herrmann's harsh strings score to the shower scene.\nAfter maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to exhibit the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at the audience (a scene which recalls his spying on his leading actresses undressing earlier in the film\u00e2\u0080\u0093by looking through a hole cut in the dressing room wall\u00e2\u0080\u0093which itself is a voyeuristic motif included in the film of Psycho). Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.\nWith the film's screening being so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife afterward for helping make it possible and they affirm their love. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting Psycho proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A raven lands on his shoulder as a reference to The Birds, before turning to meet with his wife.\nThe final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after Psycho, none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an Oscar, the American Film Institute awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979 - an award he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "North by Northwest"}], "question": "In 1959, what piece of work does Alfred Hitchcock debut?", "id": "ee6f2d470966fa272e00d6ad19d12a706545faff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ed Gein"}], "question": "Psycho is based on the crimes of who?", "id": "ee6f2d470966fa272e00d6ad19d12a706545faff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Whitfield Cook"}], "question": "What friend of Alma gets her attention?

Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston. Over the years, Costello grooms him to become a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police, until Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.\nBefore graduating from the police academy, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is recruited by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to go undercover, as his family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. He drops out of the academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.\nEach man infiltrates his respective organization, and Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Costigan is seeing her under the terms of his probation, and they begin a relationship, too. After Costello escapes a sting operation, each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is told to find the \"rat\" and asks Costello for information to identify the informer.\nCostigan follows Costello into a porn theater, where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through Chinatown. When it is over, neither man knows the other's identity. Sullivan has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of a building. Queenan orders Costigan to flee while he confronts Costello's men alone. The men then throw Queenan off the building to his death. When they exit, Costigan pretends he has come to join them. Television news reports that crew member Delahunt (Mark Rolston) has been a Boston Police Department undercover cop, but Costello believes it to be a lie probably designed to lull him into a sense of security. Dignam resigns rather than work with Sullivan, who he suspects is the mole after he is asked why he had Queenan followed.\nUsing Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary of Costello's role as an informant for the FBI, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between Costello's crew and the police, which results in most of the crew being killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant. Costello tries to shoot Sullivan, but Sullivan shoots him multiple times. With Costello dead, Sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force. In good faith, Costigan comes to Sullivan for restoration of his true identity and to be paid for his work, but notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk and flees, finally realizing Sullivan is the enemy. Fearing retaliation, Sullivan erases Costigan's records from the police computer system.\nSullivan is unaware that Madolyn had an affair with Costigan when she tells Sullivan that she is pregnant. Later, Sullivan finds her listening to a CD from Costigan containing incriminating recorded conversations between Costello and Sullivan. Sullivan unsuccessfully attempts to assuage her suspicions. He then contacts Costigan, who reveals that Costello recorded every one of their conversations, that Costello's attorney left Costigan in possession of the recordings, and that Costigan intends to implicate Sullivan. The two agree to meet at the building where Queenan died.\nOn the roof, Costigan catches Sullivan off-guard and handcuffs him. As Costigan had secretly arranged, Trooper Brown (Anthony Anderson) appears on the roof as well. Shocked, Brown draws his gun on Costigan, who attempts to justify his actions by exposing Sullivan as Costello's mole. Costigan asks Brown why Dignam did not accompany him as Costigan had requested, but Brown does not answer. Costigan leads Sullivan, his hostage, to the elevator. When it reaches the ground floor, Trooper Barrigan (James Badge Dale) shoots Costigan in the head, then shoots Brown, and afterward reveals to Sullivan that Costello had more than one mole in the police. Sullivan then shoots and kills Barrigan. At state police headquarters, Sullivan identifies Barrigan as the mole and recommends Costigan for the Medal of Merit.\nAt Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful.

Pierre works as a doctor, and Jean is a lawyer. It recounts the story of a middle-class French family whose lives are changed when L\u00e9on Mar\u00e9chal, a deceased family friend, leaves his inheritance to Jean. This provokes Pierre to doubt the fidelity of his mother and the legitimacy of his brother. Pierre discovers that his theories about his brother's illegitimacy are correct when he finds and reads old letters that his mother and L\u00e9on Marechal had been sending to each other. This investigation sparks violent reactions in Pierre, whose external appearance vis a vis his mother visibly changes. In his anguish, most notably shown during family meals, he tortures her with allusions to the past that he has now uncovered. Meanwhile, Jean's career and love life improve over the course of the novel while Pierre's life gets significantly worse. Provoked by his brother's accusations of jealousy, Pierre reveals to Jean what he has learned. However, unlike Pierre, Jean offers his mother love and protection. The novel closes with Pierre\u2019s departure on an oceanliner. Thus the novel is organised around the unwelcome appearance of a truth (Jean\u2019s illegitimacy), its suppression for the sake of family continuity and the acquisition of wealth, and the expulsion from the family of the legitimate son.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Gerome Roland."}], "question": "What is Pierre and Jean's father's name?

He uses the last remaining public phone booth in the city to contact Pam. During the call, he is interrupted by a pizza delivery man, who attempts to deliver a free pizza to him, but Stu rudely turns him away by insulting his weight. As soon as Stu completes his call to Pam, the phone rings. Stu answers, to find that The Caller, who knows his name, warns him not to leave the booth, and says he will say hello to Pam for him. He also says he will call Kelly, leaving Stu panicked.\nThe caller tells Stu that he has tested two previous individuals who have done wrong deeds in a similar manner (one was a pedophile, the other was a company insider who cashed out his stock options before the share price collapsed), giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged, but in both cases, neither agreed and were killed. To demonstrate the threat, the caller fires a suppressed sniper rifle at a toy robot sold by a nearby vendor; the damage is unseen by anyone but Stu, the caller, and the vendor. The caller demands that Stu confess his feelings for Pam to both Kelly and Pam to avoid being killed. The caller contacts Pam, and puts her on line with Stu, who reveals that he is married. The caller then hangs up, telling Stu to call Kelly himself.\nAs Stu hesitates, the booth is approached by three prostitutes demanding to use the phone. Stu refuses to leave, having been warned by the caller to stay in the booth and not reveal the situation. Leon (John Enos III), the prostitutes' pimp, joins his charges, smashes the side of the booth, grabs at Stu in a headlock and starts punching him. The caller offers to \"make him stop\" and asks if Stu can hear him, which Stu just answers positively, causing the caller to misunderstand Stu and shoot Leon. Leon staggers away before collapsing dead in the street. The prostitutes immediately blame Stu, making a scene over Leon's body, accusing him of having a gun as the police and news crews converge on the location.\nPolice Captain Ed Ramey (Forest Whitaker), already suspecting Stu of being the killer, seals off the streets with police roadblocks and starts trying to negotiate to get him to leave the booth, but Stu refuses, telling the caller that there is no way they can incriminate him; the caller proves him wrong, calling his attention to a handgun that was planted in the roof of the phone booth. Both Kelly and Pam soon arrive on the scene. The caller demands that Stu tell Kelly the truth, which he does. The caller then orders Stu to choose between Kelly and Pam, and the woman he does not choose will be killed.\nWhile on the phone with the caller, Stu secretly uses his cell phone to call Kelly, allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller. She, in turn, quietly informs Captain Ramey of this. Meanwhile, Stu continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie, to make himself look more important than he really is or even feels. Stu's confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the payphone call to a nearby building, and Ramey uses coded messages to inform Stu of this. Stu warns the caller that the police are on the way, and the caller replies that if he is caught, then he will kill Kelly. Panicked, Stu grabs the handgun and leaves the booth, screaming for the sniper to kill him instead of Kelly. The police fire upon Stu, while a smaller force breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to, only to find the gun and a man's corpse.\nStu regains consciousness to find the police fired only rubber bullets at him, stunning but not harming him. Stu and Kelly happily reunite. As the police bring down the body, Stu identifies it as the pizza delivery man from earlier. Stu gets medical treatment at a local ambulance; as he does, a man with a briefcase (Kiefer Sutherland) passes by and says that he regrets killing the pizza deliverer and warns Stu that if his new-found honesty does not last, he will be hearing from him again.

Emmet Walsh). Deckard, whose job as a \"Blade Runner\" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and \"retire\" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.\nDeckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the \"Voight-Kampff\" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, Leon (Brion James), shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants: Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.\nDeckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that Dr. Eldon Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) assistant Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion\". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.\nEvents are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\nWhile searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, but Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's dropped pistol. The two return to Deckard's apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt her; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard physically restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.\nArriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of \"Methuselah Syndrome\", a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone. Though not shown, it is implied by Bryant via police radio that Roy also kills Sebastian.\nUpon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy starts to die, he chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As Roy's life runs out, he delivers a monologue about how his memories \"will be lost like tears in rain\"; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard, \"It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?\" Deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar, but Rachael is safe, asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices a small tin-foil origami unicorn on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff's final words. Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Los Angeles"}], "question": "In what city is Deackard a police officer?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Graff"}], "question": "Who detins Deckard?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Blade Runner"}], "question": "Whiile a police officer, what was Deckard's job?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Replicants"}], "question": "Who are Blade Runner's in charge of tracking down?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "retire them"}], "question": "What is a Blade Runner supposed to do when they find a replicant?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "killing them"}], "question": "Retiring a relpicant is a euphamism for what?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "human"}], "question": "The replicant Rachael believes she is what?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a family photo"}], "question": "What does Racahel show Deckard in order to convince him she is human?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tyrell's niece"}], "question": "Whose memories are implanted in Rachael?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a strip club"}], "question": "Where does Zhora work?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Track down replicants and retire them"}], "question": "What does a Blade Runner do?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Four years"}], "question": "How long do Nexus-6 models live for?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It's a test designed to distinguigh between humans and replicants based on their emotional responses."}], "question": "What's the Voight-Kampff test do?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She was given emotional padding in the form of false memories."}], "question": "How is Rachael different from other Replicants?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory"}], "question": "Where do Roy and Leon go to investiage?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "So they can force Tyrell to extend their lives."}], "question": "Why are the rogue replicants searching for Tyrell?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A genetic premature aging disorder"}], "question": "What is the Methuselah Syndrome?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Roy"}], "question": "Who chases Deckard through a building?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Like tears in the rain as they will be lost forever"}], "question": "How does Roy describe his memories as he dies?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An origami unicorn"}], "question": "What does Deckard notice on the floor at the end?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Rick Deckard"}], "question": "Who is the ex-cop in 2019 ?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A person who tracks down bioengineered beings replicants and kills them or retire them."}], "question": "What is a Blade Runner?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tyrell"}], "question": "Who has a penthouse?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Roy"}], "question": "Who kills Tyrell in his penthouse?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Deckard and Rachael"}], "question": "Who left the apartment alive together?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "his memories"}], "question": "What will be lost like tears in the rain?", "id": "ef722cf82033c8e66197209f06a9cb9754be78d9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "J.

Homicide detective Nick Curran investigates, and the only suspect is Catherine Tramell, Boz's bisexual girlfriend and a crime novelist who has written a novel that mirrors the crime. It is concluded that either Catherine herself did it or someone trying to frame her out of spite. Tramell is uncooperative and taunting in the investigation, smoking in the interrogation room and exposing her bare genitalia in front of the officers. She presents alibis and passes a lie detector test. Nick discovers that Catherine has a habit of befriending murderers, including her girlfriend Roxy, who is later shown to have murdered several young boys on impulse, and Hazel Dobkins, who murdered her family.\nNick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he has had an affair. Nick discovers that Catherine plans on using him as a fictional detective in her latest book, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Catherine becomes aware of Nick's past after paying Lt. Nielsen to look into Nick's psychiatric file; Beth gives it to him after Nielsen recommends Nick's termination. Nick publicly assaults Nielsen in his office and later becomes a prime suspect after Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when he joins in her behavior in front of his co-workers, he is put on leave.\nA torrid affair between Nick and Catherine begins with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. Nick shows up at a club and witness her sniffing coke in a bathroom stall along with Roxy and another man. Nick and Catherine begins to dance and make out at a club. Later, observed by Roxy, they have sex in a bed. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car but dies in a crash when the car goes off the edge of the road. Catherine is saddened by Roxy's death and reveals to Nick that a previous lesbian encounter at college went away when the girl, Lisa Hoberman, became obsessed with her, causing him to believe that she may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth Garner, who acknowledges the encounter but claims Catherine was the one who became obsessed.\nNick discovers the final pages of Catherine's new book in which the fictional detective finds his partner lying dead with his legs protruding between the doors of an elevator. Catherine breaks off their affair; Nick becomes upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at an office building to find out what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick. Nick runs into the building but is too late; he finds Gus' legs protruding from the doors of the elevator. Beth, standing in the hallway, explains she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects she murdered Gus and when he believes she is reaching for a gun, he shoots her only to find that Beth was only fingering an ornament on her key chain.\nA search of the scene and Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to identify her as the killer.

Hunting for ivory is the least of their worries, as they find out some old friends are being held hostage by the fearsome tribes of the red pygmies.\nSwift builds two major inventions in this volume. The first is a replacement airship, known as The Black Hawk. This new airship is to replace The Red Cloud, which was destroyed during his adventures in Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice. This airship is of the same general construction as The Red Cloud, but is smaller and more maneuverable.\nOf foremost notice is Swift's invention of the electric rifle, a gun which fires bolts of electricity. The electric rifle can be calibrated to different levels of range, intensity and lethality; it can shoot through solid walls without leaving a hole, and is powerful enough to kill a rampaging whale, as in their steamer trek to Africa. With the electric rifle, Tom and friends bring down elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffalo, and save their lives several times in pitched battle with the red pygmies. It also can discharge a globe of light that was described as being able to maintain itself, like ball lightning, making hunting at night much safer in the dark of Africa.

Kaufman is going through depression and is not happy that his twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is taking advantage of him. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee's famous seminars.\nCharlie, who rejects formulaic script writing, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of The Orchid Thief. However, he comes to realize that the book does not have a usable narrative and that it is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well over his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing at writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Unable to face her and with the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clich\u0102\u0160d psychological thriller, called The 3, is selling for six or seven figures, Kaufman resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.\nDonald pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but is suspicious of her account of the events of her book because she acts as though she is lying. He and his brother Charlie follow Orlean to Florida where she meets Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of Orlean's book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid in order to manufacture a drug that causes fascination; Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, she decides that Charlie must die.\nOrlean forces Charlie at gunpoint to drive to the swamp, where she intends to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences and Charlie's problems with women. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Fleeing, Charlie and Donald drive off but crash into a ranger's truck; Donald dies in the accident. Charlie runs off into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche. However, Laroche is killed by an alligator before being able to kill Charlie.\nOrlean is arrested. Charlie makes up with his mother, tells his former love interest Amelia that he is still in love with her, and finishes the script. It ends with Charlie in a voice-over announcing the script is finished and that he wants G\u0102\u0160rard Depardieu to portray him in the film.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Orchid Thief"}], "question": "What screenplay has Charlie been hired to write?

Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter Miss Dormouse sell peppermints and candles, but the candles \"behave very strangely in warm weather\" and Miss Dormouse refuses to accept the return of candle ends from disgruntled customers.\nFinally, Sally Henny-penny sends out a printed poster announcing her intention to re-open the shop. The villagers are delighted and overwhelm the shop on its first day. Sally gets flustered counting out change and insists on being paid cash but offers an assortment of bargains to the delight of everybody.\nPotter put a crowd of familiar characters from the Peter Rabbit universe into the tale such as Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, Samuel Whiskers and Peter himself. It would prove a clever marketing device. From the literary angle, the many familiar characters create tension and suspense for the reader as most are the natural prey of the eponymous merchants. The reader wonders if the two shopkeepers will control their predatory instincts long enough to make a sale.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "With credit."}], "question": "How did

off from her newspaper job, Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) prints a letter from a fictional unemployed \"John Doe\" threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society's ills. When the letter causes a sensation among readers, and the paper's competition suspects a fraud and starts to investigate, editor Henry Connell (James Gleason) is persuaded to rehire Mitchell, who schemes to boost the newspaper's sales by exploiting the fictional John Doe. From a number of derelicts who show up at the paper claiming to have written the original letter, Mitchell and Connell hire John Willoughby (Gary Cooper), a former baseball player and tramp in need of money to repair his injured arm (by Bonesetter Brown), to play the role of John Doe. Mitchell starts to pen a series of articles in Doe's name, elaborating on the original letter's ideas of society's disregard for people in need.\nWilloughby gets $50, a new suit of clothes, and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend \"The Colonel\" (Walter Brennan), who launches into an extended diatribe against \"the heelots\", lots of heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others. Proposing to take Doe national via the radio, Mitchell is given $100 a week by the newspaper's publisher, D. B. Norton (Edward Arnold), to write radio speeches for Willoughby. Meanwhile, Willoughby is offered a $5,000 bribe from a rival newspaper to admit the whole thing was a publicity stunt, but ultimately turns it down and delivers the speech Mitchell has written for him instead. Afterward, feeling conflicted, he runs away, riding the rails with the Colonel until they reach Millsville. \"John Doe\" is recognized at a diner and brought to City Hall, where he's met by Bert Hanson (Regis Toomey), who explains how he was inspired by Doe's words to start a \"John Doe club\" with his neighbors.\nThe John Doe philosophy spreads across the country, developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is, \"Be a better neighbor\". However, Norton secretly plans to channel support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions. When a John Doe rally is scheduled, with John Doe clubs from throughout the country in attendance, Norton instructs Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate. On the night of the rally, Willoughby, who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself, learns of Norton's treachery from a drunken Connell. He denounces Norton and tries to expose the plot at the rally, but Norton speaks first, exposing Doe as a fake and claiming to have been deceived, like everyone else, by the staff of the newspaper. Despondent at letting his now-angry followers down, Willoughby plans to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on Christmas Eve, as indicated in the original John Doe letter. Mitchell, who has fallen in love with Willoughby, desperately tries to talk him out of jumping (saying another John Doe has already died for the sake of humanity), and Hanson and his neighbors tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club. Convinced not to kill himself, Willoughby leaves, carrying a fainted Mitchell in his arms, and Connell turns to Norton and says, \"There you are, Norton! The people! Try and lick that!\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Commit suicide."}], "question": "What does the fictional character \"John Doe\" threaten to do?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Christmas Eve."}], "question": "What day does John Doe threaten to commit suicide?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Baseball player."}], "question": "What was John Willoughby's previous career?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A rival newspaper"}], "question": "Who bribes Willoughby?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "$5000."}], "question": "How much was  Willoughby bribed for?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Be a better neighbor"}], "question": "What slogan does the John Doe movement create?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To use John Doe for support for his political ambitions."}], "question": "What is Norton's underlying plan?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A drunken Connell."}], "question": "Who does Willoughby learn about Norton's plans from?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jumping off from the roof of city hall on Christmas Eve."}], "question": "What does Willoughby plan on doing after Doe is exposed as a fake?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mitchell."}], "question": "Who has fallen in love with Willoughby and desperately convinces him not to jump?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Baseball Player"}], "question": "What was John Willoughby's former occupation?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To repair his injured arm."}], "question": "What did John Willoughby need money for?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Write speeches for Willoughby"}], "question": "What was Ann Mitchell given $100 a week to do?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Be a better neighbor"}], "question": "What is the slogan of the grassroots movement inspired by the John Doe philosophy?", "id": "f23e68e4250fa5806231e17f196c6c5148af1d58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Becoming president"}], "question": "What secret ambition motivated D.B.

George Wells (Rod Taylor), an inventor. Bedraggled and exhausted, George arrives and begins to describe the strange experiences he has had since the group last met.\nAt their earlier dinner, on December 31, 1899, George describes time as \"the fourth dimension\" to David Filby (Alan Young), Dr. Philip Hillyer (Sebastian Cabot), Anthony Bridewell (Tom Helmore), and Walter Kemp (Whit Bissell). He shows them a small model of his time machine and asks a guest to press a tiny lever. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal.\nGeorge bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in the Great War. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping in 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \"a new war\"; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966, finding his neighbourhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover, but he does not understand the danger. A nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him. George continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels far into the future until the topography changes. Hundreds of thousands of years later, the rock erodes away to reveal that London is now gone, and has been replaced by a lush, green and unspoilt landscape.\nGeorge stops in AD 802,701 near the base of a towering sphinx. He goes exploring and finds a group of delicate young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help but none of her companions show any concern. George rescues her and is surprised when, revived, she walks away without a word; later, she seeks him out, giving him a flower. She says her name is Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and tells George her people are called the Eloi. He soon learns the Eloi do not operate machines, work, read, and know virtually nothing of history; they do not even understand fire.\nGeorge decides to leave but discovers his machine has been dragged into the sphinx. Weena tells him \"Morlocks\", who only come out at night, have moved it. A Morlock jumps out from behind bushes and tries to drag her away, but the creature's light-sensitive eyes are blinded by George's fire torch; he easily rescues her.\nThe next day, Weena shows George domed, well-like structures that dot the landscape; they are air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld. She takes him to an ancient museum where \"talking rings\" tell of a centuries-long nuclear war in the distant past. A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements, while some decided to return to the surface. George realises this marked the beginning of speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft but turns back when sirens blare from atop the sphinx. He emerges to find Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state, entering open doors at its base. The sirens stop and the doors close, trapping Weena inside.\nGeorge enters the Morlocks' subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are the free range livestock for the cannibalistic Morlocks. After finding Weena, he begins fighting the creatures. His efforts inspire other Eloi, who begin to defend themselves. George sets a fire and urges the Eloi to clamber out of the caverns to the surface, where he directs them to gather dry tree branches and drop them down the shafts. Smoke billows out of the shafts, and the subterranean cavern later collapses.\nThe next morning, George finds the sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open. His time machine sits just inside, a trap set by the Morlocks. He enters, the doors close, and he is attacked in the dark. George sends his time machine hurtling into the past, returning to 1900. It comes to rest on the lawn outside his house, where his story ends.\nGeorge's friends are again skeptical. He produces Weena's flower and Filby, an amateur botanist, says the species is completely unknown in the 19th century. George bids his guests a good evening.

A millionaire who died some years previously had provided in his will for the payment of $175,000,000 to the first person to stand at the North Pole.\nBefore Jeffson leaves, he hears a sermon by a Scottish priest, named Mackay, speaking against Polar research, calling the failure of all previous expeditions the will of God, and prophesying a terrible fate for those who attempt to go against God's will. Jeffson at the same time remembers his meeting with a man who claimed that the universe is a place of strife between vague \"powers\", \"The White\" and \"The Black\", for dominance.\nThroughout the events of the polar journey, Jeffson gradually discovers that his course has been, for many years, guided by these forces, all the way up to the point when he reaches the pole. He finds a huge clear lake of spinning water, with a rocky island inlaid with inscriptions. Upon seeing this, Jeffson suddenly faints. When he returns to his camp he, along with his dogs, feels nauseated after having smelled a peculiar peach-like odour. He also notices a moving purple cloud, spreading in the far heavens. During the progress of his journey, he discovers dead animals, all without the slightest sign of injury, and he gradually learns of the death of his entire crew on board the Boreal.\nThe ship being fairly easy to operate, he sets out by himself. First he travels towards northern islands, but upon seeing the death of all various races from around the world there (the result of an exodus, escaping the death-bringing cloud), and meeting ships crowded with corpses, he comes instead to the dead continent, walking through London, searching for news of the cloud. He looks for any survivors in shut mines, but finds all barricades broken through by mad crowds. Later, he goes to the house of Arthur Machen (an actual close friend of Shiel's), whom he finds dead, having been writing a poem until the very end. There, he finds the notebook into which he writes his whole narrative.\nThe later parts of the book describe Jeffson's descent into mad pompousness: adopting Turkish attire, he declares himself monarch and burns down cities (including Paris, Bordeaux, London, and San Francisco) for pleasure. He then commits his life to one task, the construction of a huge and colossal golden palace on the isle of Imbros, which he means to dedicate as an altar to God and a palace to himself. He spends seventeen years on the palace, several times abandoning the work, until its completion, when he recognizes the vanity of it.\nWhile travelling through Constantinople, which he also burns down, he meets a twenty-year-old naked woman who is without the slightest knowledge of anything in the world. She continues to follow him, no matter how he mistreats her. Gradually, he accepts her, but forces her to wear a veil over her mouth. Her speed at learning astonishes him, so he teaches her to speak, read, cook, fish, and dress.\nThe girl (who is unable to pronounce \"r\", instead saying \"l\") reveals that she had lived her whole life in a cellar below the royal palace of Turkey, and that she knew nothing of the world until she was freed when Jeffson burned down Constantinople. She becomes absorbed in the Bible and declares the humans who sought for riches as \"spoiled\".\nJeffson struggles mightily against his growing affection towards the girl, wishing to end the human race. At the very end, when he leaves to go to England, she telephones him about the re-appearance of the Purple Cloud over France. He rushes to her, embracing her as his wife and now hoping to find a way to escape the cloud. She tells him to trust that God will not allow her to die. He concludes his writing by saying that he has accepted his role and that after three weeks have passed no purple cloud has appeared, and he looks forward to the two of them becoming the progenitors of future humanity.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The North Pole"}], "question": "Where is the expedition headed?", "id": "f3e2078f74f7621ccbe1ceb3b3c9e68b6516db3a"}, {"answers":

financier of a railroad project in Tsavo, Kenya, is furious because the project is running behind schedule. He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, African foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project.\nThat night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workmen and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position.\nPatterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife. Soon, while the workers are gathering wood and building fire pits around the tents, a lion attacks the camp in the middle of the day. While Patterson, Starling and Samuel are tracking it to one end of the camp, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, killing Starling with a slash to the throat and injuring Patterson. Despite the latter's efforts to kill them, both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters; they have always been solitary hunters. The men, led by Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson. Work on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England to protect the workers, but is denied. During a visit to the camp, Beaumont tells Patterson he will ruin his reputation if the bridge is not finished on time and that he will contact the famous hunter Charles Remington to help because Patterson has been unable to kill the animals.\nRemington arrives with skilled Maasai warriors to help kill the lions. They dub the lions \"the Ghost\" and \"the Darkness\" because of their notorious methods of attack. The initial attempt fails when Patterson's borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, but Remington stays behind. He constructs a new hospital for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. When the lions fall for the trap, Remington and Patterson shoot at them; they flee and attack the new hospital, killing many patients and Dr. Hawthorne. Abdullah and the construction men leave, and only Patterson, Remington, and Samuel remain behind to face the marauders. Patterson and Remington locate the animals' lair, discovering the bones of dozens of the lions' victims. That night, Remington kills one of the pair by using Patterson and a baboon as bait. The men celebrate, though later Patterson dreams about his wife and infant son visiting him in Tsavo, only for them to be killed by the remaining lion before he can get to them.\nWaking from his nightmare the next morning, Patterson discovers that the remaining lion has dragged Remington from his tent and killed him; Patterson and Samuel cremate Remington's corpse on a pyre at the spot where he died. Grief-stricken and desperate to end the carnage, the two men burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the camp (and the ambush they set there). The lion attacks Patterson and Samuel on the partially constructed bridge and after a lengthy fight, Patterson finally kills it.

Also unlike both the source and most of Morris's other fantasies, there is little or no supernatural element in this version of the story.\nChristopher is portrayed as initially ignorant of his true identity, leading to an emotional conflict between the protagonists to reconcile their mutual love and attraction with what they believe to be the profound disparity in their social status and shame of their forced marriage. This situation is resolved when the two fall in with Jack of the Tofts, who gives refuge to Christopher after his sons rescue the hero from an assassination attempt by a servant of the usurper Earl Rolf.\nJack informs Christopher of his true station and gathers together an army to help him challenge the usurper.

Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die.\nConroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him.\nHis kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay $5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to $1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy.\nLater on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company. Brenner calls back and explains that the explosions that had damaged his coffin earlier were in fact several F-16 bombings, and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Conroy begins to lose all hope and does a last will and testament in video form, giving his son all of his clothes and his wife his personal savings. Jabir calls back demanding that Conroy video record himself cutting his finger off, threatening Conroy's family back home in Michigan if he refuses, saying that he lost all of his children. Conroy records himself cutting off one of his fingers and sends the video.\nShortly after making the video, the cell phone rings, Paul begins to hear shovels and distorted voices. The voices come clearer, saying to open the coffin, and the coffin opens. But abruptly, it becomes obvious he hallucinated the encounter.\nAfter some minutes, Brenner calls, notifying Conroy that they have found his location and are driving out to find him. Then Conroy's wife Linda calls him, so Conroy hangs up on Brenner. She cries with him and begs him to promise her that he will come home. He promises, but hangs up due to another call from Brenner. Brenner reports that they have found the site. The group starts to dig up a coffin, but Conroy cannot hear anyone near the coffin. When they open it, the coffin turns out to be Mark White's, not Conroy's, indicating that White was never rescued. Paul starts to cry as he realizes he is not going to be saved. The sand fills his coffin and he suffocates to death as the light goes out and the screen goes black. The last thing we hear is Brenner, repeating, \"I'm sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.\" as the connection finally times out and the end credits begin to roll.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Paul Conroy"}], "question": "What was the name of the

Normandy, France. The veteran walks around the cemetery and, upon seeing one specific gravestone, collapses to his knees, overwhelmed by emotion.\nThe film flashes back to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy Invasion, as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. Captain John H. Miller, a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with \"S. Ryan\" inscribed on the back of his uniform, is shown.\nMeanwhile, in Washington, D.C, at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy. Marshall, after reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter, orders that Ryan must be found and sent home immediately.\nThree days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company\u00e2\u0080\u0094T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Private First Class Richard Reiben, Privates Stanley Mellish, Adrian Caparzo, Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade\u00e2\u0080\u0094and T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer who speaks French and German, loaned from the 29th Infantry Division. Miller and his men move out to Neuville; there, they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division. Caparzo dies after being shot by a sniper.\nEventually, they locate a Private James Ryan, but soon learn that he is not their man. They find a member of Ryan's regiment who informs them that his drop zone was at Vierville and that his and Ryan's companies had the same rally point. Once they reach it, Miller meets a friend of Ryan's, who reveals that Ryan is defending a strategically important bridge over the Merderet River in the fictional town of Ramelle. On the way to Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position, despite the misgivings of his men. Wade is fatally wounded in the ensuing skirmish, but Miller, at Upham's urging, declines to execute a surviving German, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", and sets him free on condition that he give himself up as a prisoner of war to the first Allied unit he encounters. No longer confident in Miller's leadership, Reiben declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission, prompting a confrontation with Horvath. The argument heats up until Miller defuses the situation by disclosing his background in civilian life, about which the squad had earlier set up a betting pool. Reiben then reluctantly decides to stay.\nUpon arrival at Ramelle, Miller and the squad come upon a small group of paratroopers, one of whom is Ryan. Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, the mission to bring him home, and that two men had been lost in the quest to find him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not consider it fair to go home, asking Miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay \"with the only brothers [he has] left.\" Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available. Using his own men and the accompanying paratroopers, Miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined town for the tanks and infantry utilizing Molotov cocktails, detonation cords, and \"sticky bombs\" made from socks and TNT.\nElements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrive with infantry and armor. Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, most of the paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish, and Horvath, are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Miller is shot and mortally wounded by a German soldier. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Upham surprises a group of German soldiers as they attempt to retreat. The German infantryman who shot Miller, \"Steamboat Willie\", raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Having witnessed Captain Miller being shot by Steamboat Willie, Upham shoots him and lets the other surviving Germans flee.\nReiben and Ryan are with Miller as he dies and says his last words, \"James ... earn this. Earn it.\" The film returns to the present and it is revealed that the veteran is Ryan and the grave he is standing at is Miller's. Ryan asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life, that he is a \"good man\" and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Miller and the others. His wife replies, \"You are.\" At this point, Ryan stands at attention and delivers a salute toward Miller's grave.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "France"}], "question": "What country is the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial located?", "id": "f6470b27b43e232e5b4458fb1dd6c194cddb2452"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "June 6, 1944"}], "question": "What day did the Normandy Invasion take place?", "id": "f6470b27b43e232e5b4458fb1dd6c194cddb2452"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "three"}], "question": "How many brothers from the Ryan family were killed in action?", "id": "f6470b27b43e232e5b4458fb1dd6c194cddb2452"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "General George Marshall"}], "question": "What was the name of the General who ordered Private James Ryan be found and returned home?", "id": "f6470b27b43e232e5b4458fb1dd6c194cddb2452"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "six"}], "question": "How many men from his company did Capt.

The writing shows Bertha depicted as a happy soul, though quite naive about the world she lives in and those closest to her. The story opened up a lot of questions, about deceit, about knowing oneself and also about the possibility of homosexuality at the start of the 20th century. The story gives us a bird's eye view of the dinner party, which is attended by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Knight, who are close friends to Bertha and Harry. Guest, Eddie Warren, is an effeminate character, who adds an interesting mix to the party. The only other guest, Pearl Fulton, is someone who Bertha is mysteriously drawn to for reasons unknown to her at the start. The interesting thing is that Bertha's husband is presented to the reader as Bertha perceives him in her mind. Because Bertha is so naive, the reader first gets the impression that Harry is a crude, disinterested person who has a strong dislike for Pearl by his conversational tone and curtness towards her as the conversation unfolds. As the dinner party progresses, Bertha questions her own interest and fascination towards Pearl. The fact that Eddie, who is most likely homosexual, is present, lends an air to the possibility that Bertha's interest in Pearl is more than a platonic feeling one has towards a friend of the same sex. It is only after Bertha analyzes her feelings towards Pearl that she realizes that the connection she feels with Pearl is their mutual attraction for Harry, and coming out of her \"blissful\" reverie she makes the discovery that Harry and Pearl are having an affair. The title to this story alludes to the sentiment that ignorance is bliss. The story leaves the question about whether it is best to live blissfully ignorant of the truth or live with the knowledge of a harsh reality.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text":

California Roman Catholic school, where a young girl named Deloris Wilson is scolded by Sister Immaculata (Lois de Banzie) for wisecracking and disobedience. The setting then changes to the present day, where Deloris (now going by the surname Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in a 1960s-themed act called The Ronelles (a parody of The Ronettes), who sing at The Moonlite Lounge of the Nevada Club in Reno, Nevada, run by her boyfriend, the mobster Vince LaRocca. After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes.\nDeloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it. Deloris 'becomes' a nun \u00e2\u0080\u0093 habit and all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 under the hand of Reverend Mother, who gives her the religious name 'Sister Mary Clarence' to complete the disguise. Mary Clarence objects to following the strictures and simple life of the convent, but comes to befriend several of the nuns, including the forever jolly Sister Mary Patrick, quiet and meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus. After sneaking into a nearby bar, Mary Clarence is chastised by Reverend Mother and put into the choir, which she has seen to be dreadful. The choir nuns, learning that Mary Clarence has a background in music, elect her to take over as choir director, which she accepts, and she rearranges them to make them better singers. At Mass one Sunday, the choir sings the \"Hail Holy Queen\" in the traditional manner beautifully before shifting into a gospel and rock-and-roll-infused performance of the hymn.\nReverend Mother is infuriated with Mary Clarence about the performance, and orders that Mary Lazarus once again become the leader the choir, but Monsignor O'Hara is thrilled with the performance as the unorthodox music brought people, including teenagers, in off the streets. Deloris convinces Monsignor O'Hara that the nuns should be going out to clean up the neighborhood. This they do, and the choir wows church visitors with their music, with Souther eventually attending a performance of \"My Guy\" (appropriately rewritten as \"My God\"). Eventually, O'Hara announces to the choir that Pope John Paul II is to visit the church to see the choir himself. Reverend Mother decides to hand in her resignation since her authority has been unintentionally undermined, but Mary Clarence offers to leave in her stead, to which the Reverend Mother disagrees.\nDetective Tate, a police officer on Vince's payroll, finds out where Deloris is and contacts Vince, who sends Joey and Willy out to grab her. Souther confronts Tate, gets him arrested, and flies to San Francisco to try and warn Mary Clarence, but Vince's men abduct her.\nThe nuns, led by the Reverend Mother, risk their lives by going to Reno to save Mary Clarence. Meanwhile, she flees Vince and his men, leading to a chase around the casino until the nuns find her and try to sneak out. Vince, Joey and Willy confront the nuns, but they are unable to bring themselves to shoot Deloris while she is in a nun's habit, and Reverend Mother proclaims Deloris is indeed a nun, to convince Vince. As Vince works up the courage to shoot her anyway, Souther bursts in and shoots him in the arm, and has the men arrested.

On their way to the Seaton Mansion, Brian stops at Warren Tyler's house to pick up his father, Bartholomew Seaton, and at the same time shows Ned a portrait of his late mother, Danielle Seaton, by the famous artist Lucien Beaulieu. The painting is in the possession of Mr. Tyler since he found it in a barn he bought.\nThe friends leave for Seaton Mansion or \"The Bat Hallow\". They wear fancy dress for the Mardi Gras celebration. Later that evening they go to the Silver Yacht Club. That night the portrait is stolen. The prime suspect is Mr. Seaton, who is supposed to have wanted his wife's portrait. All the evidence points to him: he was wearing a bat costume, like the thief, and he was missing at the crucial time, around 10:00\u00c2\u00a0p.m.\nNancy cannot resist the challenge of the mystery. Her investigation leads to the French Quarter where she sees a woman who looks like Danielle except that her face is scarred. She is shocked and hypothesizes that Danielle could have survived the sailboat accident.\nLater she finds out the woman is Mariel Devereaux, whose father Max is an art forger. Nancy concludes that Max used his daughter as a model for the painting because of her almost perfect resemblance to Danielle. He purposely left it in the barn so that it would be found by Mr. Tyler, Danielle's suitor and Bartholomew's rival. His plan was to steal his own painting and ransom it for a million dollars. The money was to pay for his daughter's plastic surgery.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Ned Nickerson"}], "question": "Who is Nancy's boyfriend?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To the Seaton Mansion"}], "question": "Where are they going on vacation?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Danielle Seaton"}], "question": "Who is the stolen portrait of?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The portrait of Mrs. Seaton"}], "question": "What is stolen on the night of the Mardi Gras party?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nancy"}], "question": "Who is trying to solve the mystery of the stolen portrait?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mariel's plastic surgery"}], "question": "What was the ransom money from the stolen painting to be used for?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a boating accident"}], "question": "How did Mrs. Seaton die?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "An art forger"}], "question": "Who is Max Devereaux?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Danielle Seaton"}], "question": "Who does Mariel look like?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Emerson College"}], "question": "What college do Brian and Ned attend?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nancy's boyfriend."}], "question": "Who is Ned Nickerson?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Seaton Mansion"}], "question": "Where is Tyler's dad at the beginning of the story?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Bat Hallow"}], "question": " Which other name does Seaton Mansion go by?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mardi Gras"}], "question": "What event are the main characters celebrating?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A painting"}], "question": "Which item gets stolen?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mr. Seaton"}], "question": "Who is the prime suspect?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "10 pm "}], "question": "When did the painting go missing?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The French Quarter"}], "question": "Where does Nancy's investigation lead her?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sailboat accident"}], "question": "How did Danielle allegedly die?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To pay for his daughter's plastic surgery."}], "question": "Why did Max need money?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Nancy's boyfriend Ned Nickerson."}], "question": "Who is invited to Brian Seaton's mansion?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Warren Tyler's."}], "question": "Whose house is Brian's father visiting at the beginning of the story?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Brian's mother Danielle Seaton."}], "question": "Who does Warren Tyler have a portrait of?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Silver Yacht Club."}], "question": "Where do Brian and Ned go to celebrate the Mardi Gras festivities?", "id": "f8544c9577a500e557ce5ea7b487c867c3de21a9"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Around 10:00 PM.

Chapters 9 (\"The Snake-Stick Man\") and 10 (\"A Raid into the Sugarlands\") were based on events that occurred in 1919. Chapter 11 (\"The Killing of Hol Rose\") was based on events that occurred in late 1920.\nChapter I, \"Something Hidden; Go and Find It,\" discusses the remoteness and ruggedness of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, the lack of realistic literature regarding its inhabitants, and gives a brief history of the region.\nChapter II, \"The Back of Beyond,\" gives a description of Medlin and discusses how the mountaineers have adapted to their environment, the difficulties in farming the rugged terrain, and grazing in the highland meadows.\nChapter III, \"The Great Smoky Mountains,\" discusses the topography, geology, wildlife and plant life of the Great Smokies range. Kephart also relates a story by a \"Mr. and Mrs. Ferris\" who ventured across the nearly-impassable crest of the central and eastern Smokies to Mount Guyot in search of plant specimens. He also discusses the harshness of the highland meadows, and recounts a story of 17 cattle freezing to death at Silers Meadow.\nChapter IV, \"A Bear Hunt in the Smokies,\" recounts a bear hunt undertaken by Kephart and several Hazel Creek natives. The party includes Granville Calhoun, a Bone Valley resident named Bill Cope (\"the hunchback\"), John Baker \"Little John\" Cable, Jr. (1855\u20131939), Matt Hyde, and Andrew Jackson \"Doc\" Jones (1851\u20131935). The chapter begins at Hall cabin amidst a windstorm and ends with the successful killing of a bear. This chapter contains one of the earliest references to the Appalachian folk song Cumberland Gap.\nChapter V, \"Moonshine Land,\" discusses Kephart's initial curiosity about moonshining, and recounts one mountaineer's justification for the practice.\nChapter VI, \"Ways That Are Dark,\" continues Kephart's discussion of moonshining, particularly how it is made in Southern Appalachia, the typical size and settings of stills, etc.\nChapter VII, \"A Leaf from the Past,\" traces the roots of moonshining to the British Isles, and explains how the practice made its way to Southern Appalachia.\nChapter VIII, \"Blockaders and the Revenue,\" discusses the ongoing conflict between moonshiners and federal revenue agents.\nChapter IX, \"The Snake-Stick Man,\" tells the story of a federal revenue agent whom Kephart calls \"Mr. Quick\" (an alias). Quick, who has a hobby of carving sticks into the form of snakes, has a polymathic expertise that Kephart finds most impressive. He is in the area to investigate illegal liquor sales at the nearby Cherokee Reservation.\nChapter X, \"A Raid into the Sugarlands,\" recounts a manhunt led by \"Mr. Quick\" into the Sugarlands, a remote valley south of Gatlinburg on the Tennessee side of the Smokies. The chapter includes an anachronistic story about a mountaineer named \"Jasper Fenn\" (based on a real-life Sugarlander named Davis Bracken, who lived near what is now the Chimneys Campground) who claimed to have read a copy of Our Southern Highlanders given to him by the Pi Beta Phi settlement school in Gatlinburg.\nChapter XI, \"The Killing of Hol Rose,\" recounts the killing of revenuer James Holland \"Hol\" Rose by J.E. \"Babe\" Burnett and Burnett's subsequent trial.\nChapter XII, \"The Outlander and the Native,\" discusses the mountaineers' attitudes toward outsiders.\nChapter XIII, \"The People of the Hills,\" describes the mountaineers' typical physical traits, work ethic, their ability to endure harsh conditions, and their general preference for mountain life over urban life.\nChapter XIV, \"The Land of Do Without,\" discusses the mountaineers' homelife, their manner of dress, the prevalence of poverty and the mountaineers' scorn of charity.\nChapter XV, \"Home Folks and Neighbor People,\" discusses gender and family roles, religion and funerary rights, music and dancing, and Christmas and New Years Day customs among the mountain people.\nChapter XVI, \"The Mountain Dialect,\" discusses mountain speech. Kephart's observations in this chapter mark one of the first serious analyses of the Southern Appalachian dialect, and one of the first to label it a distinct dialect rather than merely the speech habits of the uneducated. While Kephart overemphasizes archaic \"Elizabethan\" traits in the dialect, linguists acknowledge his keen observations and painstaking scholarship in this analysis.\nChapter XVII, \"The Law of the Wilderness,\" discusses the mountaineers' penchant for self-reliance and individualism, the importance of family bonds, and attitudes toward government.\nChapter XVIII, \"The Blood-Feud,\" discusses Appalachian clan feuding, its typical causes, and how it compares to other cultural clan feuds, such as Corsican vendettas.\nChapter XIV, \"Who Are the Mountaineers?\", traces the Scotch-Irish roots and migration patterns of the Southern Appalachian mountaineers, and emphasizes that the Appalachian culture is a distinct culture spread across the highlands of several states.\nChapter XX, \"When the Sleeper Awakes,\" discusses how encroaching commercialism and modernity, brought to the region by logging firms and other corporations, threatened to erode the mountain culture.", "qas":

Hintock, and concerns the efforts of an honest woodsman, Giles Winterborne, to marry his childhood sweetheart, Grace Melbury. Although they have been informally betrothed for some time, her father has made financial sacrifices to give his adored only child a superior education and no longer considers Giles good enough for her. When the new doctor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a well-born and handsome young man named Edgar Fitzpiers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 takes an interest in Grace, her father does all he can to make Grace forget Giles, and to encourage what he sees as a brilliant match. Grace has misgivings prior to the marriage as she sees a village woman (Suke Damson) coming out of his cottage very early in the morning and suspects he has been sleeping with her. She tells her father that she does not want to go on with the marriage and he becomes very angry. Later Fitzpiers tells her Suke has been to visit him because she was in agony from toothache and he extracted a molar. Grace clutches at this explanation - in fact Fitzpiers has started an affair with Suke some weeks previously. After the honeymoon, the couple take up residence in an unused wing of Melbury's house. Soon, however, Fitzpiers begins an affair with a rich widow named Mrs. Charmond, which Grace and her father discover. Grace finds out by chance that Suke Damson has a full set of teeth and realises that Fitzpiers lied to her. The couple become progressively more estranged and Fitzpiers is assaulted by his father-in-law after he accidentally reveals his true character to him. Both Suke Damson and Mrs Charmond turn up at Grace's house demanding to know whether Fitzpiers is all right - Grace addresses them both sarcastically as \"Wives -all\". Fitzpiers later deserts Grace and goes to the Continent with Mrs Charmond. Grace realises that she has only ever really loved Giles but as there is no possibity of divorce feels that her love seems hopeless.\nMelbury is told by a former legal clerk down on his luck that the law was changed in the previous year (making the setting of the action 1858) and divorce is now possible. He encourages Giles to resume his courtship of Grace. It later becomes apparent, however, that Fitzpiers' adultery is not sufficient for Grace to be entitled to a divorce. When Fitzpiers quarrels with Mrs. Charmond and returns to Little Hintock to try to reconcile with his wife, she flees the house and turns to Giles for help. He is still convalescing from a dangerous illness, but nobly allows her to sleep in his hut during stormy weather, whilst he insists on sleeping outside. As a result, he dies. Grace later allows herself to be won back to the (at least temporarily) repentant Fitzpiers, thus sealing her fate as the wife of an unworthy man. This is after Suke's husband Timothy Tangs has set a man trap to try to crush Fitzpiers' leg but it only tears Grace's skirt.\nNo one is left to mourn Giles except a courageous peasant girl named Marty South,who has always loved him. Marty is a plain girl whose only attribute is her beautiful hair. She is persuaded to sell this at the start of the story to a barber who is procuring it for Mrs Charmond, after Marty realises that Giles loves Grace and not her. She precipitates the final quarrell between Fitzpiers and Mrs Charmond by writing to Fitzpiers and telling him of the origin of most of Mrs Charmond's hair.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0,

Cotton and Joshua Eddowes, which in its turn was based on a chapbook ca. 1711, and reprinted in 'The Classic Fairy Tales' by Iona and Peter Opie in 1974.\nThe tale is set during the reign of King Arthur and tells of a young Cornish farmer's son named Jack who is not only strong but so clever he easily confounds the learned with his penetrating wit. Jack encounters a cattle-eating giant called Cormoran (Cornish: 'The Giant of the Sea' SWF:Kowr-Mor-An) and lures him to his death in a pit trap. Jack is dubbed 'Jack the Giant-Killer' for this feat and receives not only the giant's wealth, but a sword and belt to commemorate the event. Another giant named Blunderbore vows vengeance for Cormoran's death and carries Jack off to an enchanted castle. Jack manages to slay Blunderbore and his brother Rebecks by hanging and stabbing them. He frees three ladies held captive in the giant's castle.\nOn a trip into Wales, Jack tricks a two-headed Welsh giant into slashing his own belly open. King Arthur's son now enters the story and Jack becomes his servant. They spend the night with a three-headed giant and rob him in the morning. In gratitude for having spared his castle, the three-headed giant gives Jack a magic sword, a cap of knowledge, a cloak of invisibility, and shoes of swiftness. On the road, Jack and the Prince meet an enchanted Lady serving Lucifer. Jack breaks the spell with his magic accessories, beheads Lucifer, and the Lady marries the Prince. Jack is rewarded with membership in the Round Table.\nJack ventures forth alone with his magic shoes, sword, cloak, and cap to rid the realm of troublesome giants. He encounters a giant terrorizing a knight and his lady. He cuts off the giant's legs then puts him to death. He discovers the giant's companion in a cave. Invisible in his cloak, Jack cuts off the giant's nose then slays him by plunging his sword into the monster's back. He frees the giant's captives and returns to the house of the knight and lady he earlier had rescued. A banquet is prepared, but it is interrupted by the two-headed giant Thunderdel chanting \"Fee, fau, fum\". Jack defeats and beheads the giant with a trick involving the house's moat and drawbridge.\nGrowing weary of the festivities, Jack sallies forth for more adventures and meets an elderly man who directs him to an enchanted castle belonging to the giant Galigantus (Galligantua, in the Joseph Jacobs version). The giant holds captive many knights and ladies and a Duke's daughter who has been transformed into a white doe through the power of a sorcerer. Jack beheads the giant, the sorcerer flees, the Duke's daughter is restored to her true shape, and the captives are freed.\nAt the court of King Arthur, Jack marries the Duke's daughter and the two are given an estate where they live happily ever after.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Four"}], "question": "How many giants has Jack killed before he becomes the Prince's

set in 13th century England and concerns the fictional outlaw Norman of Torn, who purportedly harried the country during the power struggle between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort. Norman is the supposed son of the Frenchman de Vac, once the king's fencing master, who has a grudge against his former employer and raises the boy to be a simple, brutal killing machine with a hatred of all things English. His intentions are partially subverted by a priest who befriends Norman and teaches him his letters and chivalry towards women.\nOtherwise, all goes according to plan. By 17, Norman is the best swordsman in all of England; by the age of 18, he has a large bounty on his head, and by the age of 19, he leads the largest band of thieves in all of England. None can catch or best him. In his hatred for the king he even becomes involved in the civil war, which turns the tide in favor of de Montfort. In another guise, that of Roger de Conde, he becomes involved with de Montfort's daughter Bertrade, defending her against her and her father's enemies. She notes in him a curious resemblance to the king's son and heir Prince Edward.\nFinally brought to bay in a confrontation with both King Henry and de Montfort, Norman is brought down by the treachery of de Vac, who appears to kill him, though at the cost of his own life. As de Vac dies, he reveals that Norman is in fact Richard, long-lost son of King Henry and Queen Eleanor and brother to Prince Edward. The fencing master had kidnapped the prince as a child to serve as the vehicle of his vengeance against the king. Luckily, Norman/Richard turns out not to be truly dead, surviving to be reconciled to his true father and attain the hand of Bertrade.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Fencing."}], "question": "What was Norman's father a master of?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A priest."}], "question": "Who befriends Norman?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "At 17."}], "question": "What age is Norman considered the best swordsman in England?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The biggest band of thieves in all of England."}], "question": "What is Norman leading at age 19?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bertrade."}], "question": "Who does Norman become involved with?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He reveals Norman is Richard, the long lost son of King Henry and the Queen, and the brother to Prince Edward."}], "question": "What does Vic reveal as he dies?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A grudge."}], "question": "What does Frenchman de Vac have against his former employee?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The fencing master."}], "question": "Who had kidnapped Norman?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Age 18."}], "question": "What age was Norman when there was a bounty on his head?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "When he was a child."}], "question": "When had Norman been kidnapped?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Frenchman de Vac"}], "question": "Who is supposed to be Norman's father?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bertrade de Montford"}], "question": "Who does Roger de Conde become involved with?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "that Norman is Richard the son of King Henry and Queen Eleanor"}], "question": "What does de Vac admit when he dies?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "he's the best swordsman in all of England"}], "question": "What happens by the time Norman is 17?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "a fencing master who kidnapped Norman in a plot against the king"}], "question": "Who is the Frenchman de Vac?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Eighteen"}], "question": "At what age is Norman the head of the largest band of thieves in England?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Norman/Richard"}], "question": "Who wins the hand of Bertrade?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "13th century England"}], "question": "When is the story set?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "to be a brutal killing machine"}], "question": "How was Norman raised?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Norman joins his side"}], "question": "Why does the civil war turn in favor of de Montfort?", "id": "fc79357de2e376b0fe00069cfe9099ac4ce51426"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "13th Centruy England.

This event caught Jim Horscroft and the two become friends. Once Jim goes off to medical school, Jack reunites with his cousin Edie, who found herself in a lot of money due to her father\u2019s death. Jack takes a liking to Edie, but is deterred when Edie shows less enthusiasm and shows great attraction to men in battle. Upon hearing this, Jack insists that he will become a soldier despite both of his parents\u2019 disapproval. Jack ultimately asks Edie to marry him. It is at this time that Jim returns to West Inch, and he quickly takes a liking to Edie, who seems much more attracted to Jim. When Jack reveals to Jim that the two are engaged he is quickly off put and sinks into depression combined with drunkenness. After a couple days, Jim recovers and is caught embracing Edie by Jack. The two argue and ultimately decide to have Edie choose. Edie chooses Jim and the two become engaged. The arrival of Lapp, a mystery French man who arrives on a small ship interrupts the peace as he claimed to have been in a ship wreck and was traveling for three days lost at sea. Jack offers him food and a place to stay while Jim is a little more hesitant. The boys quickly realize Lapp is very rich and has many battle scores that are only outmatched by his endless war stories that charm everyone, including Edie. Lapp claims he is to stay there until he is needed. Lapp becomes a regular in the community, Jack suspects Lapp is a spy after he catches him sneaking around on multiple occasions. When Jim goes off to finish school and get his diploma, Edie reveals to Jack that she had married Lapp, and the next day Lapp leaves on a ship and reveals in a note that he actually is Bonaventure De Lissac who is Napolon\u2019s aid. This angers Jim great as he learns Napoleon has escaped and is on the move. Jim offers his service to Major Elliot, to which Jack joins quickly. Major Elliot trains the boys as they prepare for the Battle of Waterloo. The French are described as having significant armor and were trained soldiers as opposed to the regiment Jack and Jim were a part of. The rest of the novel describes in vivid detail a soldier\u2019s account of the Battle of Waterloo, with Jim and Jack walk from a half-mile away as the battle ensues before joining the battle at the very end. The ending of the book describes the French being defeated by the Duke of Wellington and Gebhard von Blucher.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jack Colder"}], "question": "Who accidentally prevented a burglary during an attempt to escape boarding school?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jim"}], "question": "Who does Edie choose between Jack and Jim?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "A French man who comes to town claiming he was in a shipwreck."}], "question": "Who is Lapp?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He's a spy"}], "question": "What does Jack suspect of Lapp?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Edie admits to Jack that she married Lapp"}], "question": "What happens when Jim goes back to school to get his diploma?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He's Bonaventure De Lissac, Napoleon's aid"}], "question": "When Lapp leaves town what does he admit in his letter?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The Battle of Waterloo"}], "question": "What battle is Jim and Jack preparing for?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "half a mile"}], "question": "How far away from Waterloo does Jim and Jack walk?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Duke of Wellington and Gebhard Von Blucher"}], "question": "Who defeats Napoleon at Waterloo?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jack Colder"}], "question": "Who is the main protagonist in this story?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Stopping a burglary at his boarding school."}], "question": "What was Jack's most noteable childhood experience?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Jack"}], "question": "Who does Edie decide to become engaged to?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He claimed to have been lost at sea for 3 days following a ship wreck."}], "question": "How did Lapp arrive in the town?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That he is a spy."}], "question": "What do Jack and Jim suspect about Lapp?", "id": "fcc0308422461028f07592872b425bc34b50b6e6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Bonaventure De Lissac,Napoleon's aid."}], "question": "What is Lapp's true identity?

On a sofa in a hotel where both are staying, they discuss their feelings. They are both already married, so they decide they must part, but are unable to do so. They then recognise the voices of their respective spouses, apparently staying together at the same hotel. They leave in confusion. Mrs Lunn and Mr. Sibthorpe Juno enter and sit together on the same sofa that the other pair have just left. Sibthorpe says he is in love with Mrs Lunn, but she says she is only mildly attracted to him. Sibthorpe wants her to either accept or reject him outright. Her willingness to merely have an affair disturbs him. Gregory and Mrs. Juno re-enter and both couples reveal their conflicting feelings. They all find they have differet views about the situation. Gregory feels that there is a morally unacceptable contradiction between his desires and his honour. Sibthorpe, in contrast, says that such mixed feelings are fine, as long as one acts according to moral principles. Mrs Lunn believes that moral rules are silly. She thinks that as long as everyone gets the best they can out of the situation, that's all that matters.

Mrs. Warren, a former prostitute and current brothel owner, is described as \"on the whole, a genial and fairly presentable old blackguard of a woman.\" Vivie, an intelligent and pragmatic young woman who has just graduated from university, has come home to get acquainted with her mother for the first time in her life. The play focuses on how their relationship changes when Vivie learns what her mother does for a living. It explains why Mrs. Warren became a prostitute, condemns the hypocrisies relating to prostitution, and criticises the limited employment opportunities available for women in Victorian Britain.Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had. She saved enough money to buy into the business with her sister, and she now owns (with Sir George) a chain of brothels across Europe. Vivie is, at first, horrified by the revelation, but then lauds her mother as a champion. However, the reconciliation ends when Vivie finds out that her mother continues to run the business even though she no longer needs to. Vivie takes an office job in the city and dumps Frank, vowing she will never marry. She disowns her mother, and Mrs. Warren is left heartbroken, having looked forward to growing old with her daughter.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Mrs. Kitty Warren Vivie."}],

a kind and considerate diner waitress, is a fan of the soap opera A Reason to Love. She has no idea that her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty to pursue a relationship with her. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership. When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car, as the LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk.\nTwo hitmen, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Betty's husband into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse.\nThat evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince), local reporter Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover), and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she gets into her car and drives off. Betty's next stop is a bar in Arizona, where the lady bartender talks about her inspiring vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from A Reason to Love \u2013 not the actor who portrays him).\nMeanwhile, the two hitmen are trying to find her, as they have finally realized that she must have the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie begins falling in love with his image of Betty, to Wesley's consternation. In Los Angeles, Betty tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost \"ex-fianc\u00e9\". She is turned down due to having \"forgotten\" her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and references but manages to get a job in the pharmacy due to her help in saving the life of the victim of a drive-by shooting.\nDespite an injunction against touching any patients, Betty becomes popular with them and their families. She ends up living with Rosa (Tia Texada), a Hispanic legal secretary who has had a series of painful love affairs and offers to help Betty find her surgeon boyfriend. Rosa learns from a colleague that \"David\" is just a soap opera character, and she goes to the pharmacy window to confront her. Betty thinks her friend is jealous and is impervious to the revelation.\nThe lawyer has an idea and supplies tickets to a charity function where George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an overimaginative fan, but something about her compels him to walk back and talk to her some more. He begins to think that Betty is an actress determined to get a part in the soap opera, so he decides to play along. After three hours of her \"staying in character\", he takes her home.\nGeorge begins falling in love with her, and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she falls out of her fantasy world back into real life, as seeing the inner workings of a television show snaps her back into reality. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the people she thought were real are just characters portrayed by actors. George confronts her for being a \"crazy person\", and Betty walks out.\nNow recovered, Betty begins to tell Rosa what happened when the two hitmen come into the house to decide what to do with them after they find the car with the drugs outside Rosa's house. The killers are interrupted by the reporter and Sheriff Ballard from Betty's hometown who have also tracked her down. A standoff ensues in which Ballard pulls out a gun from an ankle holster and shoots and kills Wesley, who is distracted by watching a taped airing of A Reason to Love. At this point, Wesley is revealed to be Charlie's son. Charlie, rather than be arrested, decides not to kill Betty and commits suicide in the bathroom.\nGeorge offers Betty a job on the show. She appears in 63 episodes and takes a vacation in Rome. Betty later plans to pursue nursing as a career.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Drugs."}], "question": "What is in the car that Betty doesn't know about?", "id": "fcf6a9c1f0b8b5d551f464275aa47fede6814558"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "George."}], "question": "Who gets Betty a job on the tv show?", "id": "fcf6a9c1f0b8b5d551f464275aa47fede6814558"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is his son."}], "question": "How is Wesley related to Charlie?", "id": "fcf6a9c1f0b8b5d551f464275aa47fede6814558"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She thinks she is a nurse from her soap opera."}], "question": "What happens to Betty's mind because of witnessing her husband's murder?", "id": "fcf6a9c1f0b8b5d551f464275aa47fede6814558"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Her ex fiance."}], "question": "Who does Betty think David is?

to determine which of Satan's (Harvey Keitel) three sons will succeed their father as ruler of Hell. Adrian (Rhys Ifans) is the most intelligent, Cassius (Tom Lister Jr.) is the toughest, and Nicky (Adam Sandler) is their father's favorite, even though Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel. Furthermore, Adrian and Cassius enjoy tormenting Nicky by claiming that his mother was a goat and assault him by controlling his body with their minds.\nHaving been the \"prince of darkness\" for ten thousand years, Satan assembles his sons to decide which of them will succeed him, but instead he keeps the throne for himself because his sons are not yet ready to be his successor and tells them that they need to learn to keep the balance between good and evil. Angered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius go to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in New York City. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more souls from entering and causing Satan's body to begin decomposing via his body literally falling apart. To stop Adrian and Cassius, Satan sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.\nAt first, Nicky has trouble staying alive on Earth. He is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time. While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice of Robert Smigel) (a friend of Nicky's father), rents an apartment with an actor named Todd (Allen Covert), and falls in love with a design student named Valerie (Patricia Arquette).\nNicky's first encounter with his brothers occurs when Adrian sees him with Valerie, takes mental control of his body and makes him scare her away. Then Nicky sees Cassius on television, possessing the referee (Dana Carvey) of a Harlem Globetrotters game. When he goes to the court and tricks Cassius into the flask, metalheads John (Jonathan Loughran) and Peter (Peter Dante) are so thrilled with his performance that they become his devoted fans. That evening, Nicky tries to apologize to Valerie. The meeting goes badly at first, but she accepts him after he explains who he is and why he is on Earth.\nThe next day, Adrian possesses the chief of the NYPD (Michael McKean) and accuses Nicky of mass murder using a rather badly edited scene from Scarface. Not knowing what to do, Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice, but his father has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off and his assistants are in a panic because the midnight deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is only hours away. Back on Earth again, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station; John and Peter inform the chief of the NYPD of Nicky's whereabouts which leads to Todd and Mr. Beefy being arrested. While waiting for Nicky, Adrian discovers their trick when he realizes that John is keeping cool whereas Peter isn't which leads him to realize that John is being possessed by Nicky. In the ensuing fight, Adrian grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her out of the way, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.\nArriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian dethrones his weakened father and takes over, rising into Central Park and starting a riotous party while all of the demons except Satan's assistant Jimmy (Blake Clark) join Adrian on Earth. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in Heaven as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother Holly (Reese Witherspoon), an angel who tells him he can defeat Adrian with the \"inner light\" that he inherited from her. After she gives him a mysterious orb, he goes to Central Park. The demons discover Nicky and try to attack him, but Nicky creates gifts for them which makes them respect Nicky enough to join him and stop Adrian, but they all run away when Adrian kills one of them. Nicky and Adrian then fight, which results in both of them sucked into the flask where they have a three-way battle with Cassius. Adrian appears to win a pitched battle by locking Nicky in the flask and turning himself into a bat, but Nicky (with Valerie's help) escapes from the flask. When he shatters the orb, Ozzy Osbourne appears, bites Adrian's head off and spits it into the flask (that scene was inspired by an actual incident in which Ozzy bit the head off of a real bat while on stage).\nWith his brothers captured, Nicky is ready to save his father. After he sins to make sure he goes to Hell by setting bees on Henry Winkler, he and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him with a boulder given to her by Ozzy. With the flow of souls restored in Hell, Satan regains his body and recommends that Nicky go back to live on Earth. As for punishment, Adrian and Cassius (still inside the flask) are shoved up Adolf Hitler's rectum. The film ends a year later, when Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son, Zachariah. In in afterword in which what happens to the characters, it is mentioned that John and Peter have died in a plane crash and are now happily living in Hell in Nicky's old bedroom.", "qas": [{"answers":

engineering company, is about to propose marriage to Sandy Lund, a woman he has known since high school. The signals consist of a repeated series of flute-like notes, which Joe recognizes. Joe plays for Sandy a tape recording he made a year earlier and it sounds just like the signal from space. Joe explains that he got the notes from a lucid dream that has come to him off and on since he was eleven. In the dream he is on a world with two moons and trees with ribbon-like leaves and he is holding a strange weapon, a kind of recoilless pistol. In his shop he makes a modified version of the weapon and when he tests it, it breaks loose from the workbench and slams into a wall hard enough to shatter the bricks.\nMeanwhile astronomers trace the signal to an asteroid, M-387, and send a radio signal to it. In response the asteroid changes its signal. With the help of Holmes, a yacht builder, Keller, an electronics expert, and several workmen, Joe builds a small spaceship propelled by a reactionless drive based on his modification of the recoilless pistol. Just in time the ship is finished and, with Holmes, Keller, Sandy, and Sandy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister Pam aboard, Joe lifts off just as the police arrive to end the project. Pursued by Nike missiles, Joe takes the ship into space and heads for Asteroid M-387.\nAfter eleven days of travel they arrive at the asteroid and see only a radio mast and the entrance to a tunnel. When they fly their ship into the tunnel a door closes behind them, lights come on, and the tunnel fills with air and artificial gravity. Finding the air breathable, the five impromptu astronauts explore the asteroid. They discover that it is a vast, empty fortress with unknown weapons still in their racks and a control room where the fluting signal originates.\nIn one room Joe finds thousands of small black cubes. When he dozes off next to one he has a lucid dream of taking part in a weapons drill. He understands that the dream that has obsessed him since childhood must have come from a fragment of a similar cube that had been found in a Cro-Magnon cave with artifacts dated to 20,000 B.C. Sandy suggests looking for cube readers, reasoning that learning from a cube by sleeping near it is inefficient. They find a pair of reading helmets and quickly begin learning all about the fortress, its weapons, and an implacable Enemy with which the garrison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civilization may have been at war for 100,000 years or more. They also learn that the Enemy has sent a new attack, one that will rip apart the solar system in a matter of days.\nUsing a procedure that Keller develops, Joe, Holmes, and Keller modify three hundred of the torpedoes they find in the fortress and launch them. The ten-foot spheres accelerate toward the enemy squadron at 160-gees, approaching the speed of light in little over two days. The torpedoes obliterate the Enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s squadron and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Then Joe notes that in a few centuries Humanity will have to go out into interstellar space to look for the Enemy.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Sandy Lund."}], "question": "Who is Joe proposing to?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They sounds like a recording he made for Sandy."}], "question": "Why does Joe recognize the notes being sent from space?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Joe, Sandy, Pam, Holmes and Keller"}], "question": "Who is on the ship that goes to space?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "11 days"}], "question": "How many days does it take for the space ship to reach the asteroid?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He has another lucid dream."}], "question": "What happens when Joe sleeps near the cubes?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It is empty."}], "question": "Who is living on the asteroid?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "With the help of helmets they found."}], "question": "How do Joe and Sandy read the cubes?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The universe will be ripped apart."}], "question": "What will happen if the Enemy attacks?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Keller."}], "question": "Who developes the procedure to destroy the Enemy?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "That humanity will have to search for the Enemy again in many years."}], "question": "What does Joe predict at the end?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "At the time of making a marriage proposal"}], "question": "At what moment does Joe become aware of the radio signals from deep space?", "id": "fe1cd0e9b95b4e75db3376d9f94ef1abe281d367"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Flute-like notes that Joe recognizes from his dream"}], "question": "What do the space signals remind Joe of?

He is assigned to be the Solar League's new ambassador to the people of Capella IV, New Texas. The position is open because the previous ambassador, Silas Cumshaw, was assassinated.\nOn the starship taking him to his new posting Silk meets his secretary/bodyguard, a native New Texan named Hoddy Ringo. The briefing books that were given to him tell him little about the New Texans and their culture and the contents of the trunk that was put aboard the ship for him appall him: contrary to the practices of the Consular Service, he will be obliged to dress in native costume and to carry a pair of automatic pistols in ejection holsters. Evidence he finds while surreptitiously searching Hoddy's quarters implies that he's being set up for assassination, with the approval of the Consular Service.\nSilk is welcomed to New Texas with a giant barbecue, where he sees a trial and learns that assassination of politicians is a legitimate part of the New Texan political process as long as the assassin can show that his victim \u00e2\u0080\u009cneeded killin'\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Back at the embassy he learns more about the murder of Silas Cumshaw, in particular the fact that the killers, three young members of the vile Bonney clan, will be going on trial as assassins, not as common murderers, in three days.\nAt the barbecue Silk meets Gglafrr Ddespttann Vuvuvu, the ambassador of the z'Srauff, humanoid aliens that look like they evolved from dogs. Part of Silk's mission involves convincing the New Texans to join the Solar League so that the Space Navy can base ships near their planet to counter the threat from the z'Srauff. The Solar League fears the possibility of a z'Srauff sneak attack on the planet.\nSilk has determined that he cannot allow the Bonneys to be convicted in the Court of Political Justice, but it's too late to have them tried as common criminals. A conviction would produce a precedent that would devastate the Diplomatic Corps by making every diplomat a legitimate target. Likewise, the Solar League cannot allow the Bonneys to go unpunished.\nThe last quarter of the story lays out the trial of the Bonney brothers. As amicus curiae Silk introduces evidence to show that the Bonneys assassinated Ambassador Cumshaw at the behest of the z'Srauff. He then persuades the court that it should not have tried the case, because Ambassador Cumshaw was not a politician within the meaning of New Texas law. Having thus got the Bonneys set free, he engages them in a gunfight and kills all three.\nShortly thereafter a z'Srauff battlefleet jumps into Capellan space only to be ambushed by the Solar League's Space Navy and effectively destroyed.

The patriarch of the family, The General, is indebted to the Frenchman de Criet and has mortgaged his property in Russia to pay only a small amount of his debt. Upon learning of the illness of his wealthy aunt, \"Grandmother\", he sends streams of telegrams to Moscow and awaits the news of her demise. His expected inheritance will pay his debts and gain Mademoiselle Blanche de Cominges's hand in marriage.\nAlexei is hopelessly in love with Polina, the General's stepdaughter, and swears an oath of servitude to her. He told her while on a walk on the Schlangenberg (a mountain in the German town) that all she had to do was give the word and he would gladly walk off the edge and plummet to his death. This leads to her asking him to go to the town's casino and place a bet for her. He refuses at first but, when goaded and reminded of his oath of undying love and servility, he succumbs and ends up winning at the roulette table. He returns to her the winnings but she will not tell him the reason she needs money. She only laughs in his face (as she does when he professes his love) and treats him with cold indifference, if not downright malice. He only learns the details of the General's and Polina's financial state later in the story through his long-time acquaintance, Mr. Astley. Astley is a shy Englishman who seems to share Alexei's fondness of Polina. He comes from English nobility and has a good deal of money.\nOne day while Polina and Alexei are on a walk they see Baron and Baroness Wurmerhelm. Polina dares him to insult the aristocratic couple and he does so with little hesitation. This sets off a chain of events that details Mademoiselle Blanche's interest in the General and gets Alexei fired as tutor of the General's children. Shortly after this, Grandmother shows up and surprises the whole party of debtors and indebted. She tells them all that she knows all about the General's debt and why the Frenchman and woman are waiting around the suite day after day. She leaves the party of death-profiteers by saying that none of them are getting any of her money. She then asks Alexei to be her guide around the town famous for its healing waters and infamous for its casino where the tables are stacked with piles of gold; she wants to gamble.\nAfter being ushered to the roulette table, she plays and wins 13,000 Friedrich's d'ors (7000-8000 roubles), a significant amount of money. After a short return to the hotel, she comes back to roulette tables and she starts to get the bug; before she leaves the town, she's lost over a hundred thousand roubles in three days.\nWhen Alexei gets back to his room after sending Grandmother off at the railway station, he's greeted by Polina. She shows him a letter where de Criet says he has started legal proceedings to sell Generals' properties mortgaged to him, but he is returning properties worth fifty thousand roubles to General for Polina's benefit. de Criet says he feels he had fulfilled all his obligations that way. Polina tells Alexei she is de Criet's mistress and she wishes she had fifty thousand to fling at de Criet's face. Upon hearing this, Alexei runs out of the room and to the casino where he in a feverish rush of excitement wins in few hours two hundred thousand florins (100 000 francs) and becomes a rich man. When he gets back to his room and the waiting Polina, he empties his pockets full of gold (Alexei estimates the weight to some 4 kilos) and bank notes onto the bed. At first she accuses him of trying to buy her like de Criet, but then she embraces him. They fall asleep on the couch. Next day, she asks for fifty thousand roubles (25 000 francs) and when he gives it to her, she flings that money at Alexei's face and runs off to Mr. Astley (they had been secretly meeting and exchanging notes and she was supposed to meet him night before but has come by mistake to Alexei's room). He doesn't see her again.\nAfter learning that the General wouldn't be getting his inheritance and that Prince Nilski is penniless, Mademoiselle Blanche leaves the hotel with her mother/chaperone for Paris and seduces Alexei to follow her. Alexei goes with them, and they stay together for almost a month, he allowing Mlle Blanche to spend his entire fortune on Mlle Blanche's personal expenses, carriages and horses, dinner dances and a wedding-party. After getting herself financially secured, in order to get an accepted status in the societies, Mlle Blanche unexpectedly marries the General, who has followed her to Paris.\nAlexei starts to gamble to survive. One day he passes Mr. Astley on a park bench in Bad Homburg and has a talk with him. He finds out from Astley that Polina is in Switzerland and actually does love him. Astley tells that Grandmother has died and left Polina and the children financially secured. The General has died in Paris. Astley gives him some money but shows little hope that he will not use it for gambling. Alexei goes home dreaming of going to Switzerland the next day and recollects what made him win at the roulette tables in the past.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "by mortgaging

J. \"Jake\" Gittes to surveil her husband, Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly oppose the creation of a new reservoir, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray, and that he can expect a lawsuit.\nRealizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Mulwray's husband is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a freshwater reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that, although huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night, the land is almost dry. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman, who slashes Gittes's nose. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer, but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries.\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of his wife's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes's fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners, who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply.\nGittes deduces that the water department is drying the land so it can be bought at a reduced price, and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners, and seemingly purchased the property a week after his death. Evelyn and Gittes bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real estate deals are surreptitiously completed in the names of its residents.\nAfter fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. Early in the morning, Evelyn has to leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows her car to a house, where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray's mistress. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will, but she confesses that she is her sister.\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions's apartment; he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for his arrival. Escobar tells him the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At Evelyn's mansion, Gittes finds her servants packing her things. He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of bifocals in it. He confronts Evelyn about her \"sister\"; after Gittes slaps her, she admits that the woman, Katherine, is her sister and her daughter: her father raped her when she was fifteen. She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\nGittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross takes the bifocals and he and his men force Gittes at gunpoint to drive them to the women. When they reach the Chinatown address, the police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and drives away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. Lawrence Walsh, one of Gittes's associates, tells him: \"Forget it, Jake.
