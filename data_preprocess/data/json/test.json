Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is \"Everybody Knows\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show.\nNobody knows the true identity of \"Hard Harry\" or \"Happy Harry Hard-on,\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide\u00e2\u0080\u0094at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.\nEventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \"problem students,\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding.\nRealizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \"talk hard.\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He is a high school student in Phoenix."}], "question": "Who is Mark Hunter?", "id": "0025577043f5090cd603c6aea60f26e236195594"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "It takes place in Mark's parents basement.

In every land he passes through he usually meets only one or two persons; these meetings often (though not always) end in the death of those he meets, either at his own hand or by that of another. He learns of his own impending death, meets Krag again, and dies shortly after learning that he is in fact Nightspore himself. The book concludes with a final revelation from Krag (who claims to be known on Earth as \"Pain\") to Nightspore about the origin of the Universe.

His friend Jeff works in the same place, but as a porter. Their real dream is to perform as radio comedians on the air, with their own show. Unfortunately they haven't convinced anyone about their great sense of humor yet. When they try to help the station receptionist, Anne Mason, by setting up a false audition for the position as singer, they are almost fired for their antics.\nThe station has financial problems related to their current moody singer Rita Wilson, and try to find a way to get rid of her. Their prayers are heard when Rita is shot and killed during a blackout when she is rehearsing for a broadcast.\nPolice detectives Marty Phillips and Delaney arrive at the scene, and even though they haven't found the murder weapon, they start suspecting a wannabe cowboy singer, Tex Barton, who tried to slip out the back door after the shooting. He was in the audience when Rita was rehearsing before the blackout.\nStation producer Farrell is afraid of being suspected as well, since he had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting. He asks Frankie, who overheard the discussion, to not tell the police about it. As a sign of gratitude, Farrell promises to give Anne a real audition for the position as singer, which is empty since Rita is gone.\nFrankie soon finds the weapon used to shoot Rita, hidden in a ventilator duct. It turns out the gun belongs to Tex, and has been used in a prior shooting by a woman named Gladys Wharton. When Frankie and Jeff audition for a comedy spot on air (with Frankie in blackface as a disguise), the police come looking for Tex. Later, Tex is found murdered in the office of the station owner.\nFrankie and Jeff decide to do a little investigation of their own, and search Tex's room to see if they can find anything. The only thing of interest is a picture of Anne, suggesting that her real name is Gladys. Anne is therefore suspected of the murder and arrested by the police. However, a while later she makes bail and is released.\nFrankie discovers from a radio station in Cheyenne that the shooter Gladys Wharton was a blonde woman who fell for one of her superiors and left her husband - Tex. Since Anne is a true brunette, Frankie concludes that Rita could be Gladys instead of Anne.\nWhen all the station executives are gathered in one room by the police, one of them, Van Martin, pulls out a gun and confesses to both crimes. When Jeff enters the room unannounced, he accidentally knocks the gun out of Van's hand and the police arrest him.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To perform as radio comedians on the air with their own show."}], "question": "What is Frankie Ryan and his friend's real dream?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They were having financial problems."}], "question": "Why was the station trying to get rid of moody singer, Rita Wilson?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Cowboy singer, Tex Barton."}], "question": "Who was in the audience while Rita Wilson was rehearsing and tried to slip out the back door before the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Station producer, Farrell."}], "question": "Who had an argument with Rita not long before the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To give Anne a real audition for the position of singer since the position is empty."}], "question": "As a sign of gratitude, what does Farrell promise Frankie by not telling the police about Farrell and Rita's argument before her death?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In a ventilator duct."}], "question": "Where was the weapon found used to kill Rita?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Anne."}], "question": "Who is arrested by the police and suspected of the murder of Rita?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "In the office of the station owner."}], "question": "Where is Tex found murdered?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Van Martin."}], "question": "Who confesses to both crimes?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He accidentally knocks the gun out of Van Martin's hand and the police arrest him."}], "question": "What happens when Jeff enters the room unannounced?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He works as a page boy at a radio station in Hollywood."}], "question": "What is Frankie Ryan's career?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "To perform as a comedian on a radio show."}], "question": "What is Frankie's dream job?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are almost fired for setting up a false audition for the role of a singer."}], "question": "What happens when Frankie and Jeff try to help the station receptionist?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "They are having financial difficulties."}], "question": "Why does the station want to get rid of their current singer?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "She is shot and killed when rehearsing for a broadcast."}], "question": "What happens to Rita during the blackout?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Tex Barton, a wannabe cowboy singer."}], "question": "Who do the police suspect in the shooting?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "He had an argument with Rita before the shooting."}], "question": "Why is the station manager afraid he might be seen as a suspect?", "id": "020773a0ca71155173ec4affe6a2496a6cb45216"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Frankie finds it in a ventilator duct.
